Help: Pol(x,{v=x}): convert x (usually a vector or a power series) into a

Description: 
 (gen,?var):pol  gtopoly($1, $2)
Doc: 
 transforms the object $x$ into a polynomial with main variable $v$. If $x$
 is a scalar, this gives a constant polynomial. If $x$ is a power series with
 non-negative valuation or a rational function, the effect is similar to
 \kbd{truncate}, i.e.~we chop off the $O(X^k)$ or compute the Euclidean
 quotient of the numerator by the denominator, then change the main variable
 of the result to $v$.
 
 The main use of this function is when $x$ is a vector: it creates the
 polynomial whose coefficients are given by $x$, with $x[1]$ being the leading
 coefficient (which can be zero). It is much faster to evaluate
 \kbd{Pol} on a vector of coefficients in this way, than the corresponding
 formal expression $a_n X^n + \dots + a_0$, which is evaluated naively exactly
 as written (linear versus quadratic time in $n$). \tet{Polrev} can be used if
 one wants $x[1]$ to be the constant coefficient:
 \bprog
 ? Pol([1,2,3])
 %1 = x^2 + 2*x + 3
 ? Polrev([1,2,3])
 %2 = 3*x^2 + 2*x + 1
 @eprog\noindent
 The reciprocal function of \kbd{Pol} (resp.~\kbd{Polrev}) is \kbd{Vec} (resp.~
 \kbd{Vecrev}).
 \bprog
 ? Vec(Pol([1,2,3]))
 %1 = [1, 2, 3]
 ? Vecrev( Polrev([1,2,3]) )

Doc: 
 transform the object $x$ into a polynomial

 If $x$ is a power series, the effect is identical to \kbd{truncate}, i.e.~it

 The main use of this function is when $x$ is a vector: it creates the
 polynomial whose coefficients are given by $x$, with $x[1]$ being the
 constant term. \tet{Pol} can be used if one wants $x[1]$ to be the leading
 coefficient:

 ($x$ by default) and precision (number of significant terms) equal to
 $d$ (= the default \kbd{seriesprecision} by default). If $s$ is a
 scalar, this gives a constant power series with precision \kbd{d}. If $s$
 is a polynomial, the precision is the maximum of \kbd{d} and the degree of
 the polynomial. If $s$ is a vector, the
 coefficients of the vector are understood to be the coefficients of the power
 series starting from the constant term (as in \tet{Polrev}$(x)$), and the
 precision $d$ is ignored.
 \bprog

Function: _def_TeXstyle
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_TeXstyle
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: the bits of this default allow
 \kbd{gp} to use less rigid TeX formatting commands in the logfile. This
 default is only taken into account when $\kbd{log} = 3$. The bits of
 \kbd{TeXstyle} have the following meaning
 
 2: insert \kbd{\bs right} / \kbd{\bs left} pairs where appropriate.
 
 4: insert discretionary breaks in polynomials, to enhance the probability of
 a good line break.
 
 The default value is \kbd{0}.

Function: _def_breakloop
Class: gp_default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_breakloop
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: if true, enables the ``break loop'' debugging mode, see
 \secref{se:break_loop}.
 
 The default value is \kbd{1} if we are running an interactive \kbd{gp}
 session, and \kbd{0} otherwise.

Function: _def_colors
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_colors
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: this default is only usable if \kbd{gp}
 is running within certain color-capable terminals. For instance \kbd{rxvt},
 \kbd{color\_xterm} and modern versions of \kbd{xterm} under X Windows, or
 standard Linux/DOS text consoles. It causes \kbd{gp} to use a small palette of
 colors for its output. With xterms, the colormap used corresponds to the
 resources \kbd{Xterm*color$n$} where $n$ ranges from $0$ to $15$ (see the
 file \kbd{misc/color.dft} for an example). Accepted values for this
 default are strings \kbd{"$a_1$,\dots,$a_k$"} where $k\le7$ and each
 $a_i$ is either
 
 \noindent $\bullet$ the keyword \kbd{no} (use the default color, usually
 black on transparent background)
 
 \noindent $\bullet$ an integer between 0 and 15 corresponding to the
 aforementioned colormap
 
 \noindent $\bullet$ a triple $[c_0,c_1,c_2]$ where $c_0$ stands for foreground
 color, $c_1$ for background color, and $c_2$ for attributes (0 is default, 1
 is bold, 4 is underline).
 
 The output objects thus affected are respectively error messages,
 history numbers, prompt, input line, output, help messages, timer (that's
 seven of them). If $k < 7$, the remaining $a_i$ are assumed to be $no$. For
 instance
 %
 \bprog
 default(colors, "9, 5, no, no, 4")
 @eprog
 \noindent
 typesets error messages in color $9$, history numbers in color $5$, output in
 color $4$, and does not affect the rest.
 
 A set of default colors for dark (reverse video or PC console) and light
 backgrounds respectively is activated when \kbd{colors} is set to
 \kbd{darkbg}, resp.~\kbd{lightbg} (or any proper prefix: \kbd{d} is
 recognized as an abbreviation for \kbd{darkbg}). A bold variant of
 \kbd{darkbg}, called \kbd{boldfg}, is provided if you find the former too
 pale.
 
 \emacs In the present version, this default is incompatible with PariEmacs.
 Changing it will just fail silently (the alternative would be to display
 escape sequences as is, since Emacs will refuse to interpret them).
 You must customize color highlighting from the PariEmacs side, see its
 documentation.
 
 The default value is \kbd{""} (no colors).

Function: _def_compatible
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_compatible
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: The GP function names and syntax
 have changed tremendously between versions 1.xx and 2.00. To help you cope
 with this we provide some kind of backward compatibility, depending on the
 value of this default:
 
 \quad \kbd{compatible} = 0: no backward compatibility. In this mode, a very
 handy function, to be described in \secref{se:whatnow}, is \kbd{whatnow},
 which tells you what has become of your favourite functions, which \kbd{gp}
 suddenly can't seem to remember.
 
 \quad \kbd{compatible} = 1: warn when using obsolete functions, but
 otherwise accept them. The output uses the new conventions though, and
 there may be subtle incompatibilities between the behavior of former and
 current functions, even when they share the same name (the current function
 is used in such cases, of course!). We thought of this one as a transitory
 help for \kbd{gp} old-timers. Thus, to encourage switching to \kbd{compatible}=0,
 it is not possible to disable the warning.
 
 \quad \kbd{compatible} = 2: use only the old function naming scheme (as
 used up to version 1.39.15), but \emph{taking case into account}. Thus
 \kbd{I} (${}=\sqrt{-1}$) is not the same as \kbd{i} (user variable, unbound
 by default), and you won't get an error message using \kbd{i} as a loop
 index as used to be the case.
 
 \quad \kbd{compatible} = 3: try to mimic exactly the former behavior. This
 is not always possible when functions have changed in a fundamental way.
 But these differences are usually for the better (they were meant to,
 anyway), and will probably not be discovered by the casual user.
 
 One adverse side effect is that any user functions and aliases that have
 been defined \emph{before} changing \kbd{compatible} will get erased if this
 change modifies the function list, i.e.~if you move between groups
 $\{0,1\}$ and $\{2,3\}$ (variables are unaffected). We of course strongly
 encourage you to try and get used to the setting \kbd{compatible}=0.
 
 Note that the default \tet{new_galois_format} is another compatibility setting,
 which is completely independent of \kbd{compatible}.
 
 The default value is \kbd{0}.

Function: _def_datadir
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_datadir
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: the name of directory containing the optional data files. For now,
 this includes the \kbd{elldata}, \kbd{galdata}, \kbd{galpol}, \kbd{seadata}
 packages.
 
 The default value is \datadir (the location of installed precomputed data,
 can be specified via \kbd{Configure --datadir=}).

Function: _def_debug
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_debug
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: debugging level. If it is non-zero, some extra messages may be printed,
 according to what is going on (see~\b{g}).
 
 The default value is \kbd{0} (no debugging messages).

Function: _def_debugfiles
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_debugfiles
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: file usage debugging level. If it is non-zero, \kbd{gp} will print
 information on file descriptors in use, from PARI's point of view
 (see~\b{gf}).
 
 The default value is \kbd{0} (no debugging messages).

Function: _def_debugmem
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_debugmem
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: memory debugging level. If it is non-zero, \kbd{gp} will regularly print
 information on memory usage. If it's greater than 2, it will indicate any
 important garbage collecting and the function it is taking place in
 (see~\b{gm}).
 
 \noindent {\bf Important Note:} As it noticeably slows down the performance,
 the first functionality (memory usage) is disabled if you're not running a
 version compiled for debugging (see Appendix~A).
 
 The default value is \kbd{0} (no debugging messages).

Function: _def_echo
Class: gp_default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_echo
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: this toggle is either 1 (on) or 0 (off). When \kbd{echo}
 mode is on, each command is reprinted before being executed. This can be
 useful when reading a file with the \b{r} or \kbd{read} commands. For
 example, it is turned on at the beginning of the test files used to check
 whether \kbd{gp} has been built correctly (see \b{e}).
 
 The default value is \kbd{0} (no echo).

Function: _def_factor_add_primes
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_factor_add_primes
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: this toggle is either 1 (on) or 0 (off). If on,
 the integer factorization machinery calls \tet{addprimes} on primes
 factor that were difficult to find (larger than $2^24$), so they are
 automatically tried first in other factorizations. If a routine is performing
 (or has performed) a factorization and is interrupted by an error or via
 Control-C, this lets you recover the prime factors already found. The
 downside is that a huge \kbd{addprimes} table unrelated to the current
 computations will slow down arithmetic functions relying on integer
 factorization; one should then empty the table using \tet{removeprimes}.
 
 The defaut value is \kbd{0}.

Function: _def_factor_proven
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_factor_proven
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: this toggle is either 1 (on) or 0 (off). By
 default, the factors output by the integer factorization machinery are
 only pseudo-primes, not proven primes. If this toggle is
 set, a primality proof is done for each factor and all results depending on
 integer factorization are fully proven. This flag does not affect partial
 factorization when it is explicitly requested. It also does not affect the
 private table managed by \tet{addprimes}: its entries are included as is in
 factorizations, without being tested for primality.
 
 The defaut value is \kbd{0}.

Function: _def_format
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_format
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: of the form x$.n$, where x (conversion style)
 is a letter in $\{\kbd{e},\kbd{f},\kbd{g}\}$, and $n$ (precision) is an
 integer; this affects the way real numbers are printed:
 
 \item If the conversion style is \kbd{e}, real numbers are printed in
 \idx{scientific format}, always with an explicit exponent,
 e.g.~\kbd{3.3 E-5}.
 
 \item In style \kbd{f}, real numbers are generally printed in \idx{fixed
 floating point format} without exponent, e.g.~\kbd{0.000033}. A large
 real number, whose integer part is not well defined (not enough significant
 digits), is printed in style~\kbd{e}. For instance \kbd{10.\pow 100} known to
 ten significant digits is always printed in style \kbd{e}.
 
 \item In style \kbd{g}, non-zero real numbers are printed in \kbd{f} format,
 except when their decimal exponent is $< -4$, in which case they are printed in
 \kbd{e} format. Real zeroes (of arbitrary exponent) are printed in \kbd{e}
 format.
 
 The precision $n$ is the number of significant digits printed for real
 numbers, except if $n<0$ where all the significant digits will be printed
 (initial default 28, or 38 for 64-bit machines). For more powerful formatting
 possibilities, see \tet{printf} and \tet{Strprintf}.
 
 The default value is \kbd{"g.28"} and \kbd{"g.38"} on 32-bit and
 64-bit machines, respectively.

Function: _def_graphcolormap
Class: gp_default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_graphcolormap
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: a vector of colors, to be
 used by hi-res graphing routines. Its length is arbitrary, but it must
 contain at least 3 entries: the first 3 colors are used for background,
 frame/ticks and axes respectively. All colors in the colormap may be freely
 used in \tet{plotcolor} calls.
 
 A color is either given as in the default by character strings or by an RGB
 code. For valid character strings, see the standard \kbd{rgb.txt} file in X11
 distributions, where we restrict to lowercase letters and remove all
 whitespace from color names. An RGB code is a vector with 3 integer entries
 between 0 and 255. For instance \kbd{[250, 235, 215]} and \kbd{"antique
 white"} represent the same color. RGB codes are a little cryptic but often
 easier to generate.
 
 The default value is [\kbd{"white"}, \kbd{"black"}, \kbd{"blue"},
 \kbd{"violetred"}, \kbd{"red"}, \kbd{"green"}, \kbd{"grey"},
 \kbd{"gainsboro"}].

Function: _def_graphcolors
Class: gp_default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_graphcolors
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: entries in the
 \tet{graphcolormap} that will be used to plot multi-curves. The successive
 curves are drawn in colors
 
 \kbd{graphcolormap[graphcolors[1]]}, \kbd{graphcolormap[graphcolors[2]]},
   \dots
 
 cycling when the \kbd{graphcolors} list is exhausted.
 
 The default value is \kbd{[4,5]}.

Function: _def_help
Class: gp_default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_help
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: name of the external help program which will be used from within
 \kbd{gp} when extended help is invoked, usually through a \kbd{??} or
 \kbd{???} request (see \secref{se:exthelp}), or \kbd{M-H} under readline (see
 \secref{se:readline}).
 
 The default value is the local of the \kbd{gphelp} script.

Function: _def_histfile
Class: gp_default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_histfile
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: name of a file where
 \kbd{gp} will keep a history of all \emph{input} commands (results are
 omitted). If this file exists when the value of \kbd{histfile} changes,
 it is read in and becomes part of the session history. Thus, setting this
 default in your gprc saves your readline history between sessions. Setting
 this default to the empty string \kbd{""} changes it to
 \kbd{$<$undefined$>$}
 
 The default value is \kbd{$<$undefined$>$} (no history file).

Function: _def_histsize
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_histsize
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: \kbd{gp} keeps a history of the last
 \kbd{histsize} results computed so far, which you can recover using the
 \kbd{\%} notation (see \secref{se:history}). When this number is exceeded,
 the oldest values are erased. Tampering with this default is the only way to
 get rid of the ones you do not need anymore.
 
 The default value is \kbd{5000}.

Function: _def_lines
Class: gp_default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_lines
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: if set to a positive value, \kbd{gp} prints at
 most that many lines from each result, terminating the last line shown with
 \kbd{[+++]} if further material has been suppressed. The various \kbd{print}
 commands (see \secref{se:gp_program}) are unaffected, so you can always type
 \kbd{print(\%)} or \b{a} to view the full result. If the actual screen width
 cannot be determined, a ``line'' is assumed to be 80 characters long.
 
 The default value is \kbd{0}.

Function: _def_log
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_log
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: this can be either 0 (off) or 1, 2, 3
 (on, see below for the various modes). When logging mode is turned on, \kbd{gp}
 opens a log file, whose exact name is determined by the \kbd{logfile}
 default. Subsequently, all the commands and results will be written to that
 file (see \b{l}). In case a file with this precise name already existed, it
 will not be erased: your data will be \emph{appended} at the end.
 
 The specific positive values of \kbd{log} have the following meaning
 
 1: plain logfile
 
 2: emit color codes to the logfile (if \kbd{colors} is set).
 
 3: write LaTeX output to the logfile (can be further customized using
 \tet{TeXstyle}).
 
 The default value is \kbd{0}.

Function: _def_logfile
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_logfile
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: name of the log file to be used when the \kbd{log} toggle is on.
 Environment and time expansion are performed.
 
 The default value is \kbd{"pari.log"}.

Function: _def_new_galois_format
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_new_galois_format
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: this toggle is either 1 (on) or 0 (off). If on,
 the \tet{polgalois} command will use a different, more
 consistent, naming scheme for Galois groups. This default is provided to
 ensure that scripts can control this behavior and do not break unexpectedly.
 
 The defaut value is \kbd{0}. This value will change to $1$ (set) in the next
 major version.

Function: _def_output
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_output
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: there are three possible values: 0
 (=~\var{raw}), 1 (=~\var{prettymatrix}), or 3
 (=~\var{external} \var{prettyprint}). This
 means that, independently of the default \kbd{format} for reals which we
 explained above, you can print results in three ways:
 
 $\bullet$ \tev{raw format}, i.e.~a format which is equivalent to what you
 input, including explicit multiplication signs, and everything typed on a
 line instead of two dimensional boxes. This can have several advantages, for
 instance it allows you to pick the result with a mouse or an editor, and to
 paste it somewhere else.
 
 $\bullet$ \tev{prettymatrix format}: this is identical to raw format, except
 that matrices are printed as boxes instead of horizontally. This is
 prettier, but takes more space and cannot be used for input. Column vectors
 are still printed horizontally.
 
 $\bullet$ \tev{external prettyprint}: pipes all \kbd{gp}
 output in TeX format to an external prettyprinter, according to the value of
 \tet{prettyprinter}. The default script (\tet{tex2mail}) converts its input
 to readable two-dimensional text.
 
 Independently of the setting of this default, an object can be printed
 in any of the three formats at any time using the commands \b{a} and \b{m}
 and \b{B} respectively.
 
 The default value is \kbd{1} (\var{prettymatrix}).

Function: _def_parisize
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_parisize
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: \kbd{gp}, and in fact any program using the PARI
 library, needs a \tev{stack} in which to do its computations. \kbd{parisize}
 is the stack size, in bytes. It is strongly recommended you increase this
 default (using the \kbd{-s} command-line switch, or a \tet{gprc}) if you can
 afford it. Don't increase it beyond the actual amount of RAM installed on
 your computer or \kbd{gp} will spend most of its time paging.
 
 In case of emergency, you can use the \tet{allocatemem} function to
 increase \kbd{parisize}, once the session is started.
 
 The default value is 4M, resp.~8M on a 32-bit, resp.~64-bit machine.

Function: _def_path
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_path
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: this is a list of directories, separated by colons ':'
 (semicolons ';' in the DOS world, since colons are preempted for drive names).
 When asked to read a file whose name is not given by an absolute path
 (does not start with \kbd{/}, \kbd{./} or \kbd{../}), \kbd{gp} will look for
 it in these directories, in the order they were written in \kbd{path}. Here,
 as usual, \kbd{.} means the current directory, and \kbd{..} its immediate
 parent. Environment expansion is performed.
 
 The default value is \kbd{".:\til:\til/gp"} on UNIX systems,
 \kbd{".;C:\bs;C:\bs GP"} on DOS, OS/2 and Windows, and \kbd{"."} otherwise.

Function: _def_prettyprinter
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_prettyprinter
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: the name of an external prettyprinter to use when
 \kbd{output} is~3 (alternate prettyprinter). Note that the default
 \tet{tex2mail} looks much nicer than the built-in ``beautified
 format'' ($\kbd{output} = 2$).
 
 The default value is \kbd{"tex2mail -TeX -noindent -ragged -by\_par"}.

Function: _def_primelimit
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_primelimit
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: \kbd{gp} precomputes a list of
 all primes less than \kbd{primelimit} at initialization time. These are used
 by many arithmetic functions, usually for trial division purposes. If you do
 not plan to invoke any of them, you can just set this to 1. The maximal value
 is a little less than $2^{32}$ (resp $2^{64}$) on a 32-bit (resp.~64-bit)
 machine.
 
 Since almost all arithmetic functions eventually require some table of prime
 numbers, PARI currently guarantees that the first 6547 primes, up to and
 including 65557, are precomputed, even if \kbd{primelimit} is $1$.
 
 The default value is \kbd{500k}.

Function: _def_prompt
Class: gp_default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_prompt
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: a string that will be printed as
 prompt. Note that most usual escape sequences are available there: \b{e} for
 Esc, \b{n} for Newline, \dots, \kbd{\bs\bs} for \kbd{\bs}. Time expansion is
 performed.
 
 This string is sent through the library function \tet{strftime} (on a
 Unix system, you can try \kbd{man strftime} at your shell prompt). This means
 that \kbd{\%} constructs have a special meaning, usually related to the time
 and date. For instance, \kbd{\%H} = hour (24-hour clock) and \kbd{\%M} =
 minute [00,59] (use \kbd{\%\%} to get a real \kbd{\%}).
 
 If you use \kbd{readline}, escape sequences in your prompt will result in
 display bugs. If you have a relatively recent \kbd{readline} (see the comment
 at the end of \secref{se:def,colors}), you can brace them with special sequences
 (\kbd{\bs[} and \kbd{\bs]}), and you will be safe. If these just result in
 extra spaces in your prompt, then you'll have to get a more recent
 \kbd{readline}. See the file \kbd{misc/gprc.dft} for an example.
 
 \emacs {\bf Caution}: PariEmacs needs to know about the prompt pattern to
 separate your input from previous \kbd{gp} results, without ambiguity. It is
 not a trivial problem to adapt automatically this regular expression to an
 arbitrary prompt (which can be self-modifying!). See PariEmacs's
 documentation.
 
 The default value is \kbd{"? "}.

Function: _def_prompt_cont
Class: gp_default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_prompt_cont
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: a string that will be printed
 to prompt for continuation lines (e.g. in between braces, or after a
 line-terminating backslash). Everything that applies to \kbd{prompt}
 applies to \kbd{prompt\_cont} as well.
 
 The defaut value is \kbd{""}.

Function: _def_psfile
Class: gp_default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_psfile
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: name of the default file where
 \kbd{gp} is to dump its PostScript drawings (these are appended, so that no
 previous data are lost). Environment and time expansion are performed.
 
 The default value is \kbd{"pari.ps"}.

Function: _def_readline
Class: gp_default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_readline
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: switches readline line-editing
 facilities on and off. This may be useful if you are running \kbd{gp} in a Sun
 \tet{cmdtool}, which interacts badly with readline. Of course, until readline
 is switched on again, advanced editing features like automatic completion
 and editing history are not available.
 
 The default value is \kbd{1}.

Function: _def_realprecision
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_realprecision
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: 
 \subsecidx{realprecision} : the number of significant digits and, at the same
 time, the number of printed digits of real numbers (see~\b{p}). Note that
 PARI internal precision works on a word basis (32 or 64 bits), hence may not
 coincide with the number of decimal digits you input. For instance to get 2
 decimal digits you need one word of precision which, on a 32-bit machine,
 actually gives you 9 digits ($9 < \log_{10}(2^{32}) < 10$):
 
 \bprog
 ? default(realprecision, 2)
       realprecision = 9 significant digits (2 digits displayed)
 @eprog
 
 The default value is \kbd{28}, resp.~\kbd{38} on a 32-bit, resp~.64-bit,
 machine.

Function: _def_recover

C-Name: sd_recover
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: this toggle is either 1 (on) or 0 (off). If you change this to $0$, any

 useful in batch job scripts.
 
 The default value is \kbd{1}.

Function: _def_secure
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_secure
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: this toggle is either 1 (on) or 0 (off). If on, the \tet{system} and
 \tet{extern} command are disabled. These two commands are potentially
 dangerous when you execute foreign scripts since they let \kbd{gp} execute
 arbitrary UNIX commands. \kbd{gp} will ask for confirmation before letting
 you (or a script) unset this toggle.
 
 The default value is \kbd{0}.

Function: _def_seriesprecision

Function: _def_simplify
Class: default
Section: default
C-Name: sd_simplify
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: this toggle is either 1 (on) or 0 (off). When the PARI library computes
 something, the type of the
 result is not always the simplest possible. The only type conversions which
 the PARI library does automatically are rational numbers to integers (when
 they are of type \typ{FRAC} and equal to integers), and similarly rational
 functions to polynomials (when they are of type \typ{RFRAC} and equal to
 polynomials). This feature is useful in many cases, and saves time, but can
 be annoying at times. Hence you can disable this and, whenever you feel like
 it, use the function \kbd{simplify} (see Chapter 3) which allows you to
 simplify objects to the simplest possible types recursively (see~\b{y}).

C-Name: sd_timer
Prototype: 
Help: 
Doc: this toggle is either 1 (on) or 0 (off). If on, every instruction
 sequence (anything ended by a

Function: algdep
Class: basic

C-Name: algdep0
Prototype: GLD0,L,
Help: algdep(x,k,{flag=0}): algebraic relations up to degree n of x, using
 lindep([1,x,...,x^(k-1)], flag).
Doc: \sidx{algebraic dependence}
 $x$ being real/complex, or $p$-adic, finds a polynomial of degree at most
 $k$ with integer coefficients having $x$ as approximate root. Note that the
 polynomial which is obtained is not necessarily the ``correct'' one. In fact
 it is not even guaranteed to be irreducible. One can check the closeness
 either by a polynomial evaluation (use \tet{subst}), or by computing the
 roots of the polynomial given by \kbd{algdep} (use \tet{polroots}).
 
 Internally, \tet{lindep}$([1,x,\ldots,x^k], \fl)$ is used. If
 \tet{lindep} is not able to find a relation and returns a lower bound for the
 sup norm of the smallest relation, \tet{algdep} returns that bound instead.
 A non-zero value of $\fl$ may improve on the default behavior
 if the input number is known to a \emph{huge} accuracy, and you suspect the
 last bits are incorrect  (this truncates the number, throwing away the least
 significant bits), but default values are usually sufficient:
 \bprog
 \\\\\\\\\ LLL
 ? \p200
 ? algdep(2^(1/6)+3^(1/5), 30);      \\ wrong in 0.8s
 ? algdep(2^(1/6)+3^(1/5), 30, 100); \\ wrong in 0.4s

 ? \p1000
 ? algdep(2^(1/6)+3^(1/5), 30, -3);  \\ right in 164s
 @eprog\noindent
 The changes in \kbd{defaultprecision} only affect the quality of the
 initial approximation to $2^{1/6} + 3^{1/5}$, \kbd{algdep} itself uses
 exact operations (the size of its operands depend on the accuracy of the
 input of course: more accurate input means slower operations).
 
 Proceeding by increments of 5 digits of accuracy, \kbd{algdep} with default
 flag produces its first correct result at 205 digits, and from then on a
 steady stream of correct results. Interestingly enough, our PSLQ also
 reliably succeeds from 205 digits on (and is 15 times slower at that
 accuracy).
 
 The above example is the test case studied in a 2000 paper by Borwein and
 Lisonek: Applications of integer relation algorithms, \emph{Discrete Math.},
 {\bf 217}, p.~65--82. The paper concludes in the superiority of the PSLQ
 algorithm, which either shows that PARI's implementation of PSLQ is lacking,
 or that its LLL is extremely good. The version of PARI tested there was
 1.39, which succeeded reliably from precision 265 on, in about 200 as much
 time as the current version.

Function: allocatemem
Class: gp
Section: programming/specific
C-Name: allocatemem0
Prototype: vDG
Help: allocatemem({s=0}): allocates a new stack of s bytes. doubles the
 stack if s is omitted.
Doc: this very special operation
 allows the user to change the stack size \emph{after} initialization. $x$
 must be a non-negative integer. If $x \neq 0$, a new stack of size
 $16*\ceil{x/16}$ bytes is allocated. If $x=0$, the size of
 the new stack is twice the size of the old one. The old stack is discarded.
 
 \misctitle{Warning} This function should be typed at the \kbd{gp} prompt in
 interactive usage, or left by itself at the start of batch files.
 It cannot be used meaningfully in loop-like constructs, or as part of a
 larger expression sequence, e.g
 \bprog
    allocatemem(); x = 1;   \\@com This will not set \kbd{x}!
 @eprog\noindent
 In fact, all loops are immediately exited, user functions terminated, and
 the rest of the sequence following \kbd{allocatemem()} is silently
 discarded, as well as all pending sequences of instructions. We just go on
 reading the next instruction sequence from the file we're in (or from the
 user). In particular, we have the following possibly unexpected behavior: in
 \bprog
    read("file.gp"); x = 1
 @eprog\noindent were \kbd{file.gp} contains an \kbd{allocatemem} statement,
 the \kbd{x = 1} is never executed, since all pending instructions in the
 current sequence are discarded.
 
 The technical reason is that this routine moves the stack, so temporary
 objects created during the current expression evaluation are not correct
 anymore. (In particular byte-compiled expressions, which are allocated on
 the stack.) To avoid accessing obsolete pointers to the old stack, this
 routine ends by a \kbd{longjmp}.

Help: bernvec(x): Vector of rational Bernoulli numbers B_0, B_2,...up to

Doc: creates a vector containing, as rational numbers,
 the \idx{Bernoulli numbers} $B_0$, $B_2$,\dots, $B_{2x}$.
 This routine is obsolete. Use \kbd{bernfrac} instead each time you need a
 Bernoulli number in exact form.
 
 \misctitle{Note} This routine is implemented using repeated independent
 calls to \kbd{bernfrac}, which is faster than the standard recursion in exact
 arithmetic. It is only kept for backward compatibility: it is not faster than
 individual calls to \kbd{bernfrac}, its output uses a lot of memory space,
 and coping with the index shift is awkward.

Function: bestappr
Class: basic
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: bestappr0
Prototype: GDGDG
Help: bestappr(x, {A},{B}): if x is real, gives the best approximation to x with
 denominator less or equal to A. If x is an intmod, returns a rational number
 congruent to x with numerator less than A and denominator less than B, which
 must be given. If x is a polmod, returns a rational functions congruent to x
 with numerator degree less than A and denominator degree less than B, which
 must be given.  Otherwise applies recursively to all components.
Doc: if $B$ is omitted, finds the best rational approximation to $x\in\R$
 using continued fractions. If $A$ is omitted, return the best approximation
 affordable given the input accuracy; otherwise make sure that denominator is
 at most equal to $A$.
 
 If $B$ is
 present perform rational modular reconstruction (see below). In both cases,
 the function applies recursively to components of complex objects
 (polynomials, vectors, \dots).
 \bprog

 ? bestappr([Pi, sqrt(2) + 'x], 10^3)
 %3 = [355/113, x + 1393/985]
 @eprog
 By definition, $n/d$ is the best rational approximation to $x$ if
 $|d x - n| < |v x - u|$ for all integers $(u,v)$ with $v \leq A$. (Which
 implies that $n/d$ is a convergent of the continued fraction of $x$.)
 
 If $x$ is an \typ{INTMOD},  (or a recursive combination of
 those), modulo $N$ say, $B$ must be present. The routine then returns the
 unique rational number $a/b$ in coprime integers $a\leq A$ and $b\leq B$ which
 is congruent to $x$ modulo $N$. If $N \leq 2AB$, uniqueness is not guaranteed
 and the function fails with an error message. If rational reconstruction is not
 possible (no such $a/b$ exists for at least one component of $x$), returns
 $-1$.

 @eprog\noindent In most concrete uses, $B$ is a prime power and we performed
 Hensel lifting to obtain $x$.
 
 If $x$ is a \typ{POLMOD}, modulo $T$ say, $B$ must be present. The routine
 then returns the unique rational function $P/Q$ with  $\deg P\leq A$ and $\deg
 Q\leq B$ which is congruent to $x$ modulo $T$. If $\deg T \leq A+B$, uniqueness
 is not guaranteed and the function fails with an error message. If rational
 reconstruction is not possible, returns $-1$.

C-Name: vecbezout
Prototype: GG
Help: bezout(x,y): returns [u,v,d] such that d=gcd(x,y) and u*x+v*y=d.
Doc: Returns $[u,v,d]$ such that $d$ is the gcd of $x,y$,
 $x*u+y*v=\gcd(x,y)$, and $u$ and $v$ minimal in a natural sense.
 The arguments must be integers or polynomials. \sidx{extended gcd}
 
 If $x,y$ are polynomials in the same variable and \emph{inexact}
 coefficients, then compute $u,v,d$ such that $x*u+y*v = d$, where $d$
 approximately divides both and $x$ and $y$; in particular, we do not obtain
 \kbd{gcd(x,y)} which is \emph{defined} to be a scalar in this case:
 \bprog
 ? a = x + 0.0; gcd(a,a)
 %1 = 1
 
 ? bezout(a,a)
 %2 = [0, 1, x + 0.E-28]
 
 ? bezout(x-Pi,6*x^2-zeta(2))
 %3 = [-6*x - 18.8495559, 1, 57.5726923]
 @eprog\noindent For inexact inputs, the output is thus not well defined
 mathematically, but you obtain explicit polynomials to check whether the
 approximation is close enough for your needs.

C-Name: bnfcompress

Help: bnfcompress(bnf): converts bnf to a much smaller sbnf, containing the
 same information. Use bnfinit(sbnf) to recover a true bnf.
Doc: computes a compressed version of \var{bnf} (from \tet{bnfinit}), a
 ``small Buchmann's number field'' (or \var{sbnf} for short) which contains
 enough information to recover a full $\var{bnf}$ vector very rapidly, but
 which is much smaller and hence easy to store and print. Calling
 \kbd{bnfinit} on the result recovers a true \kbd{bnf}, in general different
 from the original. Note that an \tev{snbf} is useless for almost all
 purposes besides storage, and must be converted back to \tev{bnf} form
 before use; for instance, no \kbd{nf*}, \kbd{bnf*} or member function
 accepts them.
 
 An \var{sbnf} is a 12 component vector $v$, as follows. Let \kbd{bnf} be
 the result of a full \kbd{bnfinit}, complete with units. Then $v[1]$ is
 \kbd{bnf.pol}, $v[2]$ is the number of real embeddings \kbd{bnf.sign[1]},
 $v[3]$ is \kbd{bnf.disc}, $v[4]$ is \kbd{bnf.zk}, $v[5]$ is the list of roots
 \kbd{bnf.roots}, $v[7]$ is the matrix $\kbd{W} = \kbd{bnf[1]}$,
 $v[8]$ is the matrix $\kbd{matalpha}=\kbd{bnf[2]}$,
 $v[9]$ is the prime ideal factor base \kbd{bnf[5]} coded in a compact way,
 and ordered according to the permutation \kbd{bnf[6]}, $v[10]$ is the
 2-component vector giving the number of roots of unity and a generator,
 expressed on the integral basis, $v[11]$ is the list of fundamental units,
 expressed on the integral basis, $v[12]$ is a vector containing the algebraic
 numbers alpha corresponding to the columns of the matrix \kbd{matalpha},
 expressed on the integral basis.

 $v[5]$.

 they are not too large. flag and tech are both optional. flag can be any of
 0: default, 1: insist on having fundamental units.

Doc: initializes a
 \var{bnf} structure. Used in programs such as \kbd{bnfisprincipal},
 \kbd{bnfisunit} or \kbd{bnfnarrow}. By default, the results are conditional
 on the GRH, see \ref{se:GRHbnf}. The result is a
 10-component vector \var{bnf}.
 
 This implements \idx{Buchmann}'s sub-exponential algorithm for computing the
 class group, the regulator and a system of \idx{fundamental units} of the
 general algebraic number field $K$ defined by the irreducible polynomial $P$
 with integer coefficients.
 
 If the precision becomes insufficient, \kbd{gp} does not strive to compute
 the units by default ($\fl=0$).
 
 When $\fl=1$, we insist on finding the fundamental units exactly. Be
 warned that this can take a very long time when the coefficients of the
 fundamental units on the integral basis are very large. If the fundamental
 units are simply too large to be represented in this form, an error message
 is issued. They could be obtained using the so-called compact representation
 of algebraic numbers as a formal product of algebraic integers. The latter is
 implemented internally but not publicly accessible yet.
 
 $\var{tech}$ is a technical vector (empty by default, see \ref{se:GRHbnf}).
 Careful use of this parameter may speed up your computations,
 but it is mostly obsolete and you should leave it alone.
 
 \smallskip
 
 The components of a \var{bnf} or \var{sbnf} are technical and never used by
 the casual user. In fact: \emph{never access a component directly, always use
 a proper member function.} However, for the sake of completeness and internal
 documentation, their description is as follows. We use the notations
 explained in the book by H. Cohen, \emph{A Course in Computational Algebraic
 Number Theory}, Graduate Texts in Maths \key{138}, Springer-Verlag, 1993,
 Section 6.5, and subsection 6.5.5 in particular.
 
 $\var{bnf}[1]$ contains the matrix $W$, i.e.~the matrix in Hermite normal
 form giving relations for the class group on prime ideal generators
 $(\goth{p}_i)_{1\le i\le r}$.
 
 $\var{bnf}[2]$ contains the matrix $B$, i.e.~the matrix containing the
 expressions of the prime ideal factorbase in terms of the $\goth{p}_i$.
 It is an $r\times c$ matrix.
 
 $\var{bnf}[3]$ contains the complex logarithmic embeddings of the system of
 fundamental units which has been found. It is an $(r_1+r_2)\times(r_1+r_2-1)$
 matrix.
 
 $\var{bnf}[4]$ contains the matrix $M''_C$ of Archimedean components of the
 relations of the matrix $(W|B)$.
 
 $\var{bnf}[5]$ contains the prime factor base, i.e.~the list of prime
 ideals used in finding the relations.
 
 $\var{bnf}[6]$ used to contain a permutation of the prime factor base, but
 has been obsoleted. It contains a dummy $0$.
 
 $\var{bnf}[7]$ or \kbd{\var{bnf}.nf} is equal to the number field data
 $\var{nf}$ as would be given by \kbd{nfinit}.
 
 $\var{bnf}[8]$ is a vector containing the classgroup \kbd{\var{bnf}.clgp}
 as a finite abelian group, the regulator \kbd{\var{bnf}.reg}, a $1$ (used to
 contain an obsolete ``check number''), the number of roots of unity and a
 generator \kbd{\var{bnf}.tu}, the fundamental units \kbd{\var{bnf}.fu}.
 
 $\var{bnf}[9]$ is a 3-element row vector used in \tet{bnfisprincipal} only
 and obtained as follows. Let $D = U W V$ obtained by applying the
 \idx{Smith normal form} algorithm to the matrix $W$ (= $\var{bnf}[1]$) and
 let $U_r$ be the reduction of $U$ modulo $D$. The first elements of the
 factorbase are given (in terms of \kbd{bnf.gen}) by the columns of $U_r$,
 with Archimedean component $g_a$; let also $GD_a$ be the Archimedean
 components of the generators of the (principal) ideals defined by the
 \kbd{bnf.gen[i]\pow bnf.cyc[i]}. Then $\var{bnf}[9]=[U_r, g_a, GD_a]$.
 
 $\var{bnf}[10]$ is by default unused and set equal to 0. This field is used
 to store further information about the field as it becomes available, which
 is rarely needed, hence would be too expensive to compute during the initial
 \kbd{bnfinit} call. For instance, the generators of the principal ideals
 \kbd{bnf.gen[i]\pow bnf.cyc[i]} (during a call to \tet{bnrisprincipal}), or
 those corresponding to the relations in $W$ and $B$ (when the \kbd{bnf}
 internal precision needs to be increased).
Variant: 
 Also available is \fun{GEN}{Buchall}{GEN P, long flag, long prec},
 corresponding to \kbd{tech = NULL}, where
 \kbd{flag} is either $0$ (default) or \tet{nf_FORCE} (insist on finding
 fundamental units). The function
 \fun{GEN}{Buchall_param}{GEN P, double c1, double c2, long nrpid, long
 flag, long prec} gives direct access to the technical parameters.

 the program adds to S all the primes : dividing flag if flag<0, or less than

 if $S$ contains all primes less than $12\log(\disc(\var{Bnf}))^2$, where
 $\var{Bnf}$ is the Galois closure of $\var{bnf}$.

Function: bnfisprincipal
Class: basic

C-Name: bnfisprincipal0
Prototype: GGD1,L,
Help: bnfisprincipal(bnf,x,{flag=1}): bnf being output by bnfinit (with
 flag<=2), gives [v,alpha], where v is the vector of exponents on
 the class group generators and alpha is the generator of the resulting
 principal ideal. In particular x is principal if and only if v is the zero
 vector. flag is optional, whose binary digits mean 1: output [v,alpha] (only v
 if unset); 2: increase precision until alpha can be computed (do not insist
 if unset).
Doc: $\var{bnf}$ being the \sidx{principal ideal}
 number field data output by \kbd{bnfinit}, and $x$ being an ideal, this
 function tests whether the ideal is principal or not. The result is more
 complete than a simple true/false answer and solves general discrete
 logarithm problem. Assume the class group is $\oplus (\Z/d_i\Z)g_i$
 (where the generators $g_i$ and their orders $d_i$ are respectively given by
 \kbd{bnf.gen} and \kbd{bnf.cyc}). The routine returns a row vector $[e,t]$,
 where $e$ is a vector of exponents $0 \leq e_i < d_i$, and $t$ is a number
 field element such that
 $$ x = (t) \prod_i  g_i^{e_i}.$$
 For \emph{given} $g_i$ (i.e. for a given \kbd{bnf}), the $e_i$ are unique,
 and $t$ is unique modulo units.
 
 In particular, $x$ is principal if and only if $e$ is the zero vector. Note
 that the empty vector, which is returned when the class number is $1$, is
 considered to be a zero vector (of dimension $0$).
 \bprog
 ? K = bnfinit(y^2+23);

 @eprog
 
 \noindent The binary digits of \fl mean:
 
 \item $1$: If set, outputs $[e,t]$ as explained above, otherwise returns
 only $e$, which is much easier to compute. The following idiom only tests
 whether an ideal is principal:
 \bprog
   is_principal(bnf, x) = !bnfisprincipal(bnf,x,0);
 @eprog
 
 \item $2$: It may not be possible to recover $t$, given the initial accuracy
 to which \kbd{bnf} was computed. In that case, a warning is printed and $t$ is
 set equal to the empty vector \kbd{[]\til}. If this bit is set,
 increase the precision and recompute needed quantities until $t$ can be
 computed. Warning: setting this may induce \emph{very} lengthy computations.
Variant: Instead of the above hardcoded numerical flags, one should
 rather use an or-ed combination of the symbolic flags \tet{nf_GEN} (include
 generators, possibly a place holder if too difficult) and \tet{nf_FORCE}

Doc: \var{bnf} being the number field data
 output by \kbd{bnfinit} and $x$ being an algebraic number (type integer,
 rational or polmod), this outputs the decomposition of $x$ on the fundamental

 More precisely, if $u_1$,\dots,$u_r$ are the fundamental units, and $\zeta$
 is the generator of the group of roots of unity (\kbd{bnf.tu}), the output is
 a vector $[x_1,\dots,x_r,x_{r+1}]$ such that $x=u_1^{x_1}\cdots

 @eprog\noindent The given $u$ is the inverse of the fundamental unit

Help: bnrdisclist(bnf,bound,{arch}): gives list of discriminants of

 The ramified Archimedean places are given by arch; all possible values are
 taken if arch is omitted. Supports the alternative syntax
 bnrdisclist(bnf,list), where list is as output by ideallist or ideallistarch
 (with units).
Doc: $\var{bnf}$ being as output by \kbd{bnfinit} (with units), computes a
 list of discriminants of Abelian extensions of the number field by increasing
 modulus norm up to bound \var{bound}. The ramified Archimedean places are
 given by \var{arch}; all possible values are taken if \var{arch} is omitted.
 
 The alternative syntax $\kbd{bnrdisclist}(\var{bnf},\var{list})$ is
 supported, where \var{list} is as output by \kbd{ideallist} or
 \kbd{ideallistarch} (with units), in which case \var{arch} is disregarded.
 
 The output $v$ is a vector of vectors, where $v[i][j]$ is understood to be in
 fact $V[2^{15}(i-1)+j]$ of a unique big vector $V$. (This awkward scheme
 allows for larger vectors than could be otherwise represented.)
 
 $V[k]$ is itself a vector $W$, whose length is the number of ideals of norm
 $k$. We consider first the case where \var{arch} was specified. Each
 component of $W$ corresponds to an ideal $m$ of norm $k$, and
 gives invariants associated to the ray class field $L$ of $\var{bnf}$ of
 conductor $[m, \var{arch}]$. Namely, each contains a vector $[m,d,r,D]$ with
 the following meaning: $m$ is the prime ideal factorization of the modulus,
 $d = [L:\Q]$ is the absolute degree of $L$, $r$ is the number of real places
 of $L$, and $D$ is the factorization of its absolute discriminant. We set $d
 = r = D = 0$ if $m$ is not the finite part of a conductor.
 
 If \var{arch} was omitted, all $t = 2^{r_1}$ possible values are taken and a
 component of $W$ has the form $[m, [[d_1,r_1,D_1], \dots, [d_t,r_t,D_t]]]$,
 where $m$ is the finite part of the conductor as above, and
 $[d_i,r_i,D_i]$ are the invariants of the ray class field of conductor
 $[m,v_i]$, where $v_i$ is the $i$-th Archimedean component, ordered by
 inverse lexicographic order; so $v_1 = [0,\dots,0]$, $v_2 = [1,0\dots,0]$,
 etc. Again, we set $d_i = r_i = D_i = 0$ if $[m,v_i]$ is not a conductor.
 
 Finally, each prime ideal $pr = [p,\alpha,e,f,\beta]$ in the prime
 factorization $m$ is coded as the integer $p\cdot n^2+(f-1)\cdot n+(j-1)$,
 where $n$ is the degree of the base field and $j$ is such that
 
 \kbd{pr = idealprimedec(\var{nf},p)[j]}.
 
 \noindent $m$ can be decoded using \tet{bnfdecodemodule}.
 
 Note that to compute such data for a single field, either \tet{bnrclassno}
 or \tet{bnrdisc} is more efficient.

 \var{bnr} structure. The following member functions are available
 on the result: \kbd{.bnf} is the underlying \var{bnf},
 \kbd{.mod} the modulus, \kbd{.bid} the \var{bid} structure associated to the
 modulus; finally, \kbd{.clgp}, \kbd{.no}, \kbd{.cyc}, \kbd{.gen} refer to the
 ray class group (as a finite abelian group), its cardinality, its elementary
 divisors, its generators.
 
 The last group of functions are different from the members of the underlying
 \var{bnf}, which refer to the class group; use \kbd{\var{bnr}.bnf.\var{xxx}}
 to access these, e.g.~\kbd{\var{bnr}.bnf.cyc} to get the cyclic decomposition
 of the class group.
 
 They are also different from the members of the underlying \var{bid}, which
 refer to $(\Z_K/f)^*$; use \kbd{\var{bnr}.bid.\var{xxx}} to access these,
 e.g.~\kbd{\var{bnr}.bid.no} to get $\phi(f)$.
 
 If $\fl=0$ (default), the generators of the ray class group are not computed,
 which saves time. Hence \kbd{\var{bnr}.gen} would produce an error.
 
 If $\fl=1$, as the default, except that generators are computed.

 vector $v$ where $v[1]$ is the vector of components of $x$ on the ray class
 group generators, $v[2]$ gives on the integral basis an element $\alpha$ such
 that $x=\alpha\prod_ig_i^{x_i}$.
 
 If $\fl=0$, outputs only $v_1$. In that case, \var{bnr} need not contain the

 If $x$ is not coprime to the modulus of \var{bnr} the result is undefined.

 the enlarged L-function associated to $L$.
 
 The generators of the ray class group are needed, and you can set $\fl=1$ if
 the character is known to be primitive. Example:
 
 \bprog
 bnf = bnfinit(x^2 - x - 57);
 bnr = bnrinit(bnf, [7,[1,1]], 1);
 bnrrootnumber(bnr, [2,1])

 $\Cl_{7\infty_1\infty_2}(\Q(\sqrt{229}))$ defined by $\chi(g_1^ag_2^b)
 = \zeta_1^{2a}\zeta_2^b$. Here $g_1, g_2$ are the generators of the
 ray-class group given by \kbd{bnr.gen} and $\zeta_1 = e^{2i\pi/N_1},
 \zeta_2 = e^{2i\pi/N_2}$ where $N_1, N_2$ are the orders of $g_1$ and
 $g_2$ respectively ($N_1=6$ and $N_2=3$ as \kbd{bnr.cyc} readily tells us).

Function: bnrstark

C-Name: bnrstark
Prototype: GDGp
Help: bnrstark(bnr,{subgroup}): bnr being as output by
 bnrinit(,,1), finds a relative equation for the class field corresponding to
 the module in bnr and the given congruence subgroup (the trivial subgroup if
 omitted) using Stark's units. The ground field and the class field must be
 totally real.
Doc: \var{bnr} being as output by \kbd{bnrinit(,,1)}, finds a relative equation
 for the class field corresponding to the modulus in \var{bnr} and the given
 congruence subgroup (as usual, omit $\var{subgroup}$ if you want the whole ray
 class group).
 
 The main variable of \var{bnr} must not be $x$, and the ground field and the
 class field must be totally real. When the base field is $\Q$, the vastly
 simpler \tet{galoissubcyclo} is used instead. Here is an example:
 \bprog
 bnf = bnfinit(y^2 - 3);
 bnr = bnrinit(bnf, 5, 1);
 bnrstark(bnr)
 @eprog\noindent
 returns the ray class field of $\Q(\sqrt{3})$ modulo $5$. Usually, one wants
 to apply to the result one of
 \bprog
 rnfpolredabs(bnf, pol, 16)     \\@com compute a reduced relative polynomial
 rnfpolredabs(bnf, pol, 16 + 2) \\@com compute a reduced absolute polynomial
 @eprog
 
 The routine uses \idx{Stark units} and needs to find a suitable auxiliary
 conductor, which may not exist when the class field is not cyclic over the
 base. In this case \kbd{bnrstark} is allowed to return a vector of
 polynomials defining \emph{independent} relative extensions, whose compositum
 is the requested class field. It was decided that it was more useful
 to keep the extra information thus made available, hence the user has to take
 the compositum herself.
 
 Even if it exists, the auxiliary conductor may be so large that later
 computations become unfeasible. (And of course, Stark's conjecture may simply
 be wrong.) In case of difficulties, try \tet{rnfkummer}:
 \bprog
 ? bnr = bnrinit(bnfinit(y^8-12*y^6+36*y^4-36*y^2+9,1), 2, 1);

 lifts an element $x=a \bmod n$ of $\Z/n\Z$

 same as \tet{lift} except that in the particular case of elements of
 $\Z/n\Z$, the lift $y$ is such that $-n/2<y\le n/2$.  A \typ{PADIC} is lifted
 as above if its valuation $v$ is non-negative; if not, returns the fraction
 $p^v$ \kbd{centerlift}$(x^{-v})$; in particular, note that rational
 reconstruction is not attempted.
 
 If $x$ is of type fraction, complex, quadratic, polynomial, power series,

 Reals are forbidden.

Help: charpoly(A,{v=x},{flag=3}): det(v*Id-A)=characteristic polynomial of
 the matrix or polmod A. flag is optional and ignored unless A is a matrix;
 it may be set to 0 (Le Verrier), 1
 (Lagrange interpolation) or 2 (use Hessenberg form), 3 (Berkowitz, default).
 All algorithms except flag = 3 (Berkowitz) assume that n! is invertible,
 where n is the dimension of the matrix.
Doc: 
 \idx{characteristic polynomial}
 of $A$ with respect to the variable $v$, i.e.~determinant of $v*I-A$ if $A$
 is a square matrix. If $A$ is not a square matrix, it returns the
 characteristic polynomial of the map ``multiplication by $A$'' if $A$ is a
 scalar, in particular a polmod. E.g.~\kbd{charpoly(I) = x\pow2+1}.
 
 The value of $\fl$ is only significant for matrices. Let $n$ be the dimension
 of $A$.
 
 If $\fl=0$, same method (Le Verrier's) as for computing the adjoint matrix,
 i.e.~using the traces of the powers of $A$. Assumes that $n!$ is
 invertible; uses $O(n^4)$ scalar operations.
 
 If $\fl=1$, uses Lagrange interpolation which is usually the slowest method.
 Assumes that $n!$ is invertible; uses $O(n^4)$ scalar operations.
 
 If $\fl=2$, uses the Hessenberg form. Assumes that the base ring is a field.
 Uses $O(n^3)$ scalar operations, but suffers from coefficient explosion
 unless the base field is finite or $\R$.
 
 If $\fl=3$, uses Berkowitz's division free algorithm, valid over any
 ring (commutative, with unit). Uses $O(n^4)$ scalar operations.
 
 If $\fl=4$, $x$ must be integral. Uses a modular algorithm.
 
 In practice one should use the default (Berkowitz) unless the base ring is
 $\Z$ (use $\fl=4$) or a field where coefficient explosion does not occur,
 e.g.~a finite field or the reals (use $\fl=2$).
Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{caract}{GEN A, long v} ($\fl=1$),
 \fun{GEN}{carhess}{GEN A, long v} ($\fl=2$), \fun{GEN}{carberkowitz}{GEN A,
 long v} ($\fl=3$) and \fun{GEN}{caradj}{GEN A, long v, GEN *pt}. In this
 last case, if \var{pt} is not \kbd{NULL}, \kbd{*pt} receives the address of
 the adjoint matrix of $A$ (see \tet{matadjoint}), so both can be obtained at

Doc: if $x$ and $y$ are both intmods or both
 polmods, creates (with the same type) a $z$ in the same residue class

 This function also allows vector and matrix arguments, in which case the
 operation is recursively applied to each component of the vector or matrix.
 For polynomial arguments, it is applied to each coefficient.
 
 If $y$ is omitted, and $x$ is a vector, \kbd{chinese} is applied recursively
 to the components of $x$, yielding a residue belonging to the same class as all
 components of $x$.
 
 Finally $\kbd{chinese}(x,x) = x$ regardless of the type of $x$; this allows
 vector arguments to contain other data, so long as they are identical in both
 vectors.

Class: basic

C-Name: compo
Prototype: GL
Help: component(x,n): the n'th component of the internal representation of
 x. For vectors or matrices, it is simpler to use x[]. For list objects such
 as nf, bnf, bnr or ell, it is much easier to use member functions starting
 with ".".
Doc: extracts the $n^{\text{th}}$-component of $x$. This is to be understood
 as follows: every PARI type has one or two initial \idx{code words}. The
 components are counted, starting at 1, after these code words. In particular
 if $x$ is a vector, this is indeed the $n^{\text{th}}$-component of $x$, if
 $x$ is a matrix, the $n^{\text{th}}$ column, if $x$ is a polynomial, the
 $n^{\text{th}}$ coefficient (i.e.~of degree $n-1$), and for power series,
 the $n^{\text{th}}$ significant coefficient.
 
 For polynomials and power series, one should rather use \tet{polcoeff}, and
 for vectors and matrices, the \kbd{[$\,$]} operator. Namely, if $x$ is a
 vector, then \tet{x[n]} represents the $n^{\text{th}}$ component of $x$. If
 $x$ is a matrix, \tet{x[m,n]} represents the coefficient of row \kbd{m} and
 column \kbd{n} of the matrix, \tet{x[m,]} represents the $m^{\text{th}}$
 \emph{row} of $x$, and \tet{x[,n]} represents the $n^{\text{th}}$
 \emph{column} of $x$.
 
 Using of this function requires detailed knowledge of the structure of the
 different PARI types, and thus it should almost never be used directly.
 Some useful exceptions:
 \bprog
     ? x = 3 + O(3^5);
     ? component(x, 2)
     %2 = 81   \\ p^(p-adic acurracy)

Help: concat(x,{y}): concatenation of x and y, which can be scalars, vectors

Doc: concatenation of $x$ and $y$. If $x$ or $y$ is
 not a vector or matrix, it is considered as a one-dimensional vector. All
 types are allowed for $x$ and $y$, but the sizes must be compatible. Note
 that matrices are concatenated horizontally, i.e.~the number of rows stays
 the same. Using transpositions, it is easy to concatenate them vertically.
 
 To concatenate vectors sideways (i.e.~to obtain a two-row or two-column
 matrix), use \tet{Mat} instead (see the example there). Concatenating a row
 vector to a matrix having the same number of columns will add the row to the
 matrix (top row if the vector is $x$, i.e.~comes first, and bottom row
 otherwise).
 
 The empty matrix \kbd{[;]} is considered to have a number of rows compatible
 with any operation, in particular concatenation. (Note that this is
 definitely \emph{not} the case for empty vectors \kbd{[~]} or \kbd{[~]\til}.)
 
 If $y$ is omitted, $x$ has to be a row vector or a list, in which case its
 elements are concatenated, from left to right, using the above rules.

Help: conjvec(z): conjugate vector of the algebraic number z.
Doc: 
 conjugate vector representation of $z$. If $z$ is a
 polmod, equal to \kbd{Mod}$(a,T)$, this gives a vector of length
 $\text{degree}(T)$ containing:
 
 \item the complex embeddings of $z$ if $T$ has rational coefficients,
 i.e.~the $a(r[i])$ where $r = \kbd{polroots}(T)$;
 
 \item the conjugates of $z$ if $T$ has some intmod coefficients;
 
 \noindent if $z$ is a finite field element, the result is the vector of
 conjugates $[z,z^p,z^{p^2},\ldots,z^{p^{n-1}}]$ where $n=\text{degree}(T)$.

 the conjugate vectors of the individual elements of $z$.

Help: content(x): gcd of all the components of x, when this makes sense.
Doc: computes the gcd of all the coefficients of $x$,
 when this gcd makes sense. This is the natural definition
 if $x$ is a polynomial (and by extension a power series) or a
 vector/matrix. This is in general a weaker notion than the \emph{ideal}
 generated by the coefficients:
 \bprog
 ? content(2*x+y)
 %1 = 1            \\ = gcd(2,y) over Q[y]
 @eprog
 
 If $x$ is a scalar, this simply returns the absolute value of $x$ if $x$ is
 rational (\typ{INT} or \typ{FRAC}), and either $1$ (inexact input) or $x$
 (exact input) otherwise; the result should be identical to \kbd{gcd(x, 0)}.
 
 The content of a rational function is the ratio of the contents of the
 numerator and the denominator. In recursive structures, if a
 matrix or vector \emph{coefficient} $x$ appears, the gcd is taken
 not with $x$, but with its content:

 for the number of terms in the continued fraction expansion.
Doc: returns the row vector whose components are the partial quotients of the
 \idx{continued fraction} expansion of $x$. In other words, a result
 $[a_0,\dots,a_n]$ means that $x \approx a_0+1/(a_1+\dots+1/a_n)$. The
 output is normalized so that $a_n \neq 1$ (unless we also have $n = 0$).
 
 The number of partial quotients $n+1$ is limited by \kbd{nmax}. If
 \kbd{nmax} is omitted, the expansion stops at the last significant partial
 quotient.
 \bprog

 %2 = [3, 7, 15]
 @eprog\noindent
 $x$ can also be a rational function or a power series.
 
 If a vector $b$ is supplied, the numerators are equal to the coefficients
 of $b$, instead of all equal to $1$ as above; more precisely, $x \approx
 (1/b_0)(a_0+b_1/(a_1+\dots+b_n/a_n))$; for a numerical continued fraction
 ($x$ real), the $a_i$ are integers, as large as possible; if $x$ is a
 rational function, they are polynomials with $\deg a_i = \deg b_i + 1$.
 The length of the result is then equal to the length of $b$, unless the next
 partial quotient cannot be reliably computed, in which case the expansion
 stops. This happens when a partial remainder is equal to zero (or too small
 compared to the available significant digits for $x$ a \typ{REAL}).
 
 A direct implementation of the numerical continued fraction
 \kbd{contfrac(x,b)} described above would be
 \bprog
 \\ "greedy" generalized continued fraction

     t = x - a[i]; if (!t || i == #b, break);
     x = b[i+1] / t;
   ); a;
 }
 @eprog\noindent There is some degree of freedom when choosing the $a_i$; the
 program above can easily be modified to derive variants of the standard
 algorithm. In the same vein, although no builtin
 function implements the related \idx{Engel expansion} (a special kind of
 \idx{Egyptian fraction} decomposition: $x = 1/a_1 + 1/(a_1a_2) + \dots$ ),
 it can be obtained as follows:
 \bprog

Doc: when $x$ is a vector or a one-row matrix, $x$
 is considered as the list of partial quotients $[a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n]$ of a
 rational number, and the result is the 2 by 2 matrix
 $[p_n,p_{n-1};q_n,q_{n-1}]$ in the standard notation of continued fractions,
 so $p_n/q_n=a_0+1/(a_1+\dots+1/a_n)$. If $x$ is a matrix with two rows
 $[b_0,b_1,\dots,b_n]$ and $[a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n]$, this is then considered as a
 generalized continued fraction and we have similarly
 $p_n/q_n=(1/b_0)(a_0+b_1/(a_1+\dots+b_n/a_n))$. Note that in this case one

Function: denominator
Class: basic
Section: conversions
C-Name: denom
Prototype: G
Help: denominator(x): denominator of x (or lowest common denominator in case
 of an array).
Doc: 
 denominator of $x$. The meaning of this
 is clear when $x$ is a rational number or function. If $x$ is an integer
 or a polynomial, it is treated as a rational number or function,
 respectively, and the result is equal to $1$. For polynomials, you
 probably want to use
 \bprog
 denominator( content(x) )
 @eprog\noindent
 instead. As for modular objects, \typ{INTMOD} and \typ{PADIC} have
 denominator $1$, and the denominator of a \typ{POLMOD} is the denominator
 of its (minimal degree) polynomial representative.
 
 If $x$ is a recursive structure, for instance a vector or matrix, the lcm
 of the denominators of its components (a common denominator) is computed.
 This also applies for \typ{COMPLEX}s and \typ{QUAD}s.
 
 \misctitle{Warning} Multivariate objects are created according to variable
 priorities, with possibly surprising side effects ($x/y$ is a polynomial, but
 $y/x$ is a rational function). See \secref{se:priority}.

Function: deriv
Class: basic
Section: polynomials
C-Name: deriv
Prototype: GDn
Help: deriv(x,{v}): derivative of x with respect to v, or to the main

Doc: 
 derivative of $x$ with respect to the main
 variable if $v$ is omitted, and with respect to $v$ otherwise. The derivative
 of a scalar type is zero, and the derivative of a vector or matrix is done
 componentwise. One can use $x'$ as a shortcut if the derivative is with
 respect to the main variable of $x$.
 
 By definition, the main variable of a \typ{POLMOD} is the main variable among
 the coefficients from its two polynomial components (representative and
 modulus); in other words, assuming a polmod represents an element of
 $R[X]/(T(X))$, the variable $X$ is a mute variable and the derivative is
 taken with respect to the main variable used in the base ring $R$.

Description: 
 (gen,gen,gen,?1):gen    diffop($1, $2, $3)

Doc: 
 Let $v$ be a vector of variables, and $d$ a vector of the same length,
 return the image of $x$ by the $n$-power ($1$ if n is not given) of the differential
 operator $D$ that assumes the value \kbd{d[i]} on the variable \kbd{v[i]}.
 The value of $D$ on a scalar type is zero, and $D$ applies componentwise to a vector
 or matrix. When applied to a \typ{POLMOD}, if no value is provided for the variable
 of the modulus, such value is derived using the implicit function theorem.
 
 Some examples:
 This function can be used to differentiate formal expressions:
 If $E=\exp(X^2)$ then we have $E'=2*X*E$. We can derivate $X*exp(X^2)$ as follow:
 \bprog
 ? diffop(E*X,[X,E],[1,2*X*E])
 %1 = (2*X^2 + 1)*E
 @eprog
 Let \kbd{Sin} and \kbd{Cos} be two function such that $\kbd{Sin}^2+\kbd{Cos}^2=1$
 and $\kbd{Cos}'=-\kbd{Sin}$. We can differentiate $\kbd{Sin}/\kbd{Cos}$ as follow,
 PARI inferring the value of $\kbd{Sin}'$ from the equation:
 \bprog

 quotient (\kbd{$x$ \bs\ $y$}), the second the Euclidean remainder
 (\kbd{$x$ - ($x$\bs$y$)*$y$}), of the division of $x$ by $y$. This avoids the
 need to do two divisions if one needs both the quotient and the remainder.
 If $v$ is present, and $x$, $y$ are multivariate
 polynomials, divide with respect to the variable $v$.
 
 Beware that \kbd{divrem($x$,$y$)[2]} is in general not the same as
 \kbd{$x$ \% $y$}; no GP operator corresponds to it:

 @eprog\noindent
 For the time being, only curves over a prime field $\F_p$ and over the
 $p$-adic or real numbers (including rational numbers) are fully supported.
 Other domains are only supported for very basic operations such as point
 addition.
 
 The result of \tet{ellinit} is an \tev{ell} structure by default, and
 a shorter \tev{sell} if $\fl=1$. Both contain the following information in
 their components:
 %
 $$ a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_6,b_2,b_4,b_6,b_8,c_4,c_6,\Delta,j.$$
 %
 All are accessible via member functions. In particular, the discriminant is
 \kbd{$E$.disc}, and the $j$-invariant is \kbd{$E$.j}.
 
 The other six components are only present if $\fl$ is $0$ or omitted, in
 which case the computation will be 10 ($p$-adic) to 200 (complex) times
 slower. Their content depends on whether the curve is defined over $\R$ or
 not:
 \smallskip
 \item When $E$ is defined over $\R$, \kbd{$E$.roots} is a vector whose
 three components contain the roots of the right hand side of the associated
 Weierstrass equation.
 $$ (y + a_1x/2 + a_3/2)^2 = g(x) $$
 If the roots are all real, they are ordered by decreasing value. If only
 one is real, it is the first component.
 
 Then $\omega_1 = $\kbd{$E$.omega[1]} is the real period of $E$ (integral of
 $dx/(2y+a_1x+a_3)$ over the connected component of the identity element of
 the real points of the curve), and $\omega_2 = $\kbd{$E$.omega[2]} is a
 complex period. \kbd{$E$.omega} forms a basis of the
 complex lattice defining $E$, such that
 $\tau=\dfrac{\omega_1}{\omega_2}$ has positive imaginary part.
 
 \kbd{$E$.eta} is a row vector containing the quasi-periods $\eta_1$ and
 $\eta_2$ such that $\eta_i = 2\zeta(\omega_i/2)$, where $\zeta$ is the
 Weierstrass zeta function associated to the period lattice (see
 \tet{ellzeta}). In particular, the Legendre relation holds:
 $\eta_2\omega_1 - \eta_1\omega_2 = 2i\pi$.
 
 Finally, \kbd{$E$.area} is the volume of the complex lattice defining
 $E$.\smallskip
 
 \item When $E$ is defined over $\Q_p$, the $p$-adic valuation of $j$
 must be negative. Then \kbd{$E$.roots} is the vector with a single component
 equal to the $p$-adic root of the associated Weierstrass equation
 corresponding to $-1$ under the Tate parametrization.
 
 \kbd{$E$.tate} yields the three-component vector $[u^2,u,q]$, in the
 notations of Tate. If the $u$-component does not belong to $\Q_p$, it is set
 to zero.
 
 \kbd{$E$.w} is Mestre's $w$ (this is technical).
 
 \smallskip For all other base fields or rings, the last six components are
 arbitrarily set to zero. See also the description of member functions
 related to elliptic curves at the beginning of this section.

 minimal at p, and c is the local Tamagawa number c_p.
Doc: 
 calculates the \idx{Kodaira} type of the
 local fiber of the elliptic curve $E$ at the prime $p$.
 $E$ must be a \var{smallell} as output by \kbd{ellinit}, and is assumed to have
 all its coefficients $a_i$ in $\Z$. The result is a 4-component vector
 $[f,kod,v,c]$. Here $f$ is the exponent of $p$ in the arithmetic conductor of
 $E$, and $kod$ is the Kodaira type which is coded as follows:
 
 1 means good reduction (type I$_0$), 2, 3 and 4 mean types II, III and IV
 respectively, $4+\nu$ with $\nu>0$ means type I$_\nu$;
 finally the opposite values $-1$, $-2$, etc.~refer to the starred types
 I$_0^*$, II$^*$, etc. The third component $v$ is itself a vector $[u,r,s,t]$
 giving the coordinate changes done during the local reduction. Normally, this
 has no use if $u$ is 1, that is, if the given equation was already minimal.
 Finally, the last component $c$ is the local \idx{Tamagawa number} $c_p$.

 assumed that $E$ is defined over $\Q$, not necessarily minimal. The optional
 parameter $A$ is a cutoff point for the integral, which must be chosen close
 to 1 for best speed. The result must be independent of $A$, so this allows
 some internal checking of the function.
 
 Note that if the conductor of the curve is large, say greater than $10^{12}$,
 this function will take an unreasonable amount of time since it uses an

C-Name: ellzeta
Prototype: GGp
Help: ellzeta(E,z): E being given by ellinit, returns the value at z of the
 Weierstrass zeta function of the period lattice of E.
Doc: 
 $E$ being given by \kbd{ellinit}, returns the
 value at $z$ of the Weierstrass $\zeta$ function of the period lattice $L$
 of $E$:
 $$ \zeta(z, L) = \dfrac{1}{z} + z^2\sum_{\omega\in L^*}
 \dfrac{1}{\omega^2(z-\omega)}.$$
 Alternatively, one can input a lattice basis $[\omega_1,\omega_2]$ directly
 instead of $E$.
 \bprog

Doc: 
 $E$ being an \var{ell} as output by
 \kbd{ellinit}, computes the coordinates $[x,y]$ on the curve $E$
 corresponding to the complex number $z$. Hence this is the inverse function
 of \kbd{ellpointtoz}. In other words, if the curve is put in Weierstrass

 the point at infinity $[0]$.

 have positive imaginary part); notice that the factor $q^{1/24}$ is
 missing!
 
 \item $q = x$ if $x$ is a \typ{PADIC}, or can be converted to a
 \emph{power series} (which must then have positive valuation).
 
 If $\fl$ is non-zero, $x$ is converted to a complex number and we return the

Prototype: GDG
Help: factor(x,{lim}): factorization of x. lim is optional and can be set

 partial factorization, using primes < lim (up to primelimit if lim=0).
Description:

 (gen, ?-1):vec        factor($1)
 (gen, small):vec      factor0($1, $2)
Doc: general factorization function, where $x$ is a
 rational (including integers), a complex number with rational
 real and imaginary parts, or a rational function (including polynomials).
 The result is a two-column matrix: the first contains the irreducibles
 dividing $x$ (rational or Gaussian primes, irreducible polynomials),
 and the second the exponents. By convention, $0$ is factored as $0^1$.
 
 \misctitle{$\Q$ and $\Q(i)$}
 See \tet{factorint} for more information about the algorithms used.
 The rational or Gaussian primes are in fact \var{pseudoprimes}
 (see \kbd{ispseudoprime}), a priori not rigorously proven primes. In fact,
 any factor which is $\leq 10^{15}$ (whose norm is $\leq 10^{15}$ for an
 irrational Gaussian prime) is a genuine prime. Use
 \kbd{isprime} to prove primality of other factors, as in
 \bprog
 ? fa = factor(2^2^7 + 1)
 %1 =
 [59649589127497217 1]
 
 [5704689200685129054721 1]
 
 ? isprime( fa[,1] )
 %2 = [1, 1]~   \\ both entries are proven primes
 @eprog\noindent
 Another possibility is to set the global default \tet{factor_proven}, which
 will perform a rigorous primality proof for each pseudoprime factor.
 
 A \typ{INT} argument \var{lim} can be added, meaning that we look only for
 prime factors $p < \var{lim}$. The limit \var{lim} must be non-negative and
 satisfy
 $\var{lim} \leq \kbd{primelimit} + 1$; setting $\var{lim}=0$ is the same
 as setting it to $\kbd{primelimit} + 1$. In this case, all but the last
 factor
 are proven primes, but the remaining factor may actually be a proven composite!
 If the remaining factor is less than $\var{lim}^2$, then it is prime.
 \bprog
 ? factor(2^2^7 +1, 10^5)
 %3 =
 [340282366920938463463374607431768211457 1]
 @eprog\noindent
 This routine uses trial division and perfect power tests, and should not be
 used for huge values
 of \var{lim} (at most $10^9$, say): \kbd{factorint(, 1 + 8)} will in general
 be faster. The latter does not guarantee that all small prime factors are
 found, but it also finds larger factors, and in a much more efficient way.

 \misctitle{Rational functions}
 The polynomials or rational functions to be factored must have scalar
 coefficients. In particular PARI does not know how to factor
 \emph{multivariate} polynomials. See \tet{factormod} and \tet{factorff} for
 the algorithms used over finite fields, \tet{factornf} for the algorithms
 over number fields. Over $\Q$, \idx{van Hoeij}'s method is used, which is
 able to cope with hundreds of modular factors.
 
 The routine guesses a sensible ring over which you want to factor: the
 smallest ring containing all coefficients, taking into account quotient
 structures induced by \typ{INTMOD}s and \typ{POLMOD}s (e.g.~if a coefficient
 in $\Z/n\Z$ is known, all rational numbers encountered are first mapped to
 $\Z/n\Z$; different moduli will produce an error).
 Note that factorization of polynomials is done up to
 multiplication by a constant. In particular, the factors of rational
 polynomials will have integer coefficients, and the content of a polynomial
 or rational function is discarded and not included in the factorization. If
 needed, you can always ask for the content explicitly:
 \bprog
 ? factor(t^2 + 5/2*t + 1)
 %1 =
 [2*t + 1 1]
 
 [t + 2 1]
 
 ? content(t^2 + 5/2*t + 1)
 %2 = 1/2
 @eprog\noindent
 See also \tet{nffactor}.
Variant: This function should only be used by the \kbd{gp} interface. Use
 directly \fun{GEN}{factor}{GEN x} or \fun{GEN}{boundfact}{GEN x, long lim}.
 The obsolete function \fun{GEN}{factor0}{GEN x, long lim} is kept for

Function: factorback
Class: basic

C-Name: factorback2
Prototype: GDG
Help: factorback(f,{e}): given a factorisation f, gives the factored

Description:

Doc: gives back the factored object
 corresponding to a factorization. The integer $1$ corresponds to the empty
 factorization.
 
 If $e$ is present, $e$ and $f$ must be vectors of the same length ($e$ being
 integral), and the corresponding factorization is the product of the
 $f[i]^{e[i]}$.
 
 If not, and $f$ is vector, it is understood as in the preceding case with $e$
 a vector of 1s: we return the product of the $f[i]$. Finally, $f$ can be a
 regular factorization, as produced with any \kbd{factor} command. A few
 examples:
 \bprog

 %1 =

 operation-compatible with $\Z/p\Z$. The result is a two-column matrix, the
 first column being the irreducible polynomials dividing $x$, and the second
 the exponents. If you want only the \emph{degrees} of the irreducible

Doc: factors the polynomial $x$ in the field
 $\F_q$ defined by the irreducible polynomial $a$ over $\F_p$. The
 coefficients of $x$ must be operation-compatible with $\Z/p\Z$. The result
 is a two-column matrix: the first column contains the irreducible factors of
 $x$, and the second their exponents. If all the coefficients of $x$ are in
 $\F_p$, a much faster algorithm is applied, using the computation of
 isomorphisms between finite fields.
 
 Either $a$ or $p$ can omitted (in which case both are ignored) if x has
 \typ{FFELT} coefficients; the function then becomes identical to \kbd{factor}:
 \bprog

 binary digits mean 1: avoid MPQS, 2: avoid first-stage ECM (may fall back on
 it later), 4: avoid Pollard-Brent Rho and Shanks SQUFOF, 8: skip final ECM
 (huge composites will be declared prime).
Doc: factors the integer $n$ into a product of
 pseudoprimes (see \kbd{ispseudoprime}), using a combination of the
 \idx{Shanks SQUFOF} and \idx{Pollard Rho} method (with modifications due to
 Brent), \idx{Lenstra}'s \idx{ECM} (with modifications by Montgomery), and
 \idx{MPQS} (the latter adapted from the \idx{LiDIA} code with the kind
 permission of the LiDIA maintainers), as well as a search for pure powers.
 The output is a two-column matrix as for \kbd{factor}: the first column
 contains the ``prime'' divisors of $n$, the second one contains the
 (positive) exponents.
 
 By convention $0$ is factored as $0^1$, and $1$ as the empty factorization;
 also the divisors are by default not proven primes is they are larger than
 $2^64$, they only failed the BPSW compositeness test (see
 \tet{ispseudoprime}). Use \kbd{isprime} on the result if you want to
 guarantee primality or set the \tet{factor_proven} default to $1$.
 Entries of the private prime tables (see \tet{addprimes}) are also included
 as is.
 
 This gives direct access to the integer factoring engine called by most
 arithmetical functions. \fl\ is optional; its binary digits mean 1: avoid
 MPQS, 2: skip first stage ECM (we may still fall back to it later), 4: avoid
 Rho and SQUFOF, 8: don't run final ECM (as a result, a huge composite may be
 declared to be prime). Note that a (strong) probabilistic primality test is
 used; thus composites might not be detected, although no example is known.
 
 You are invited to play with the flag settings and watch the internals at
 work by using \kbd{gp}'s \tet{debug} default parameter (level 3 shows
 just the outline, 4 turns on time keeping, 5 and above show an increasing
 amount of internal details).

 factorization over $\Q$ (\idx{Trager}'s trick). The direct approach of
 \tet{nffactor}, which uses \idx{van Hoeij}'s method in a relative setting, is
 in general faster.
 
 The main variable of $t$ must be of \emph{lower} priority than that of $x$
 (see \secref{se:priority}). However if non-rational number field elements
 occur (as polmods or polynomials) as coefficients of $x$, the variable of
 these polmods \emph{must} be the same as the main variable of $t$. For

 Galois with Galois group ``weakly'' super-solvable, see below;
 returns 0 otherwise. Hence this permits to quickly check whether a polynomial
 of order strictly less than $36$ is Galois or not.
 
 The algorithm used is an improved version of the paper
 ``An efficient algorithm for the computation of Galois automorphisms'',
 Bill Allombert, Math.~Comp, vol.~73, 245, 2001, pp.~359--375.
 
 A group $G$ is said to be ``weakly'' super-solvable if there exists a
 normal series
 
 $\{1\} = H_0 \triangleleft H_1 \triangleleft \cdots \triangleleft H_{n-1}
 \triangleleft H_n$
 
 such that each $H_i$ is normal in $G$ and for $i<n$, each quotient group
 $H_{i+1}/H_i$ is cyclic, and either $H_n=G$ (then $G$ is super-solvable) or
 $G/H_n$ is isomorphic to either $A_4$ or $S_4$.
 
 In practice, almost all small groups are WKSS, the exceptions having order
 36(1 exception), 48(2), 56(1), 60(1), 72(5), 75(1), 80(1), 96(10) and $\geq

 (\kbd{\var{gal}.roots}).
 
 $\var{gal}[4]$ is the inverse of the Vandermonde matrix of the
 $p$-adic roots of \var{pol}, multiplied by $\var{gal}[5]$.
 
 $\var{gal}[5]$ is a multiple of the least common denominator of the
 automorphisms expressed as polynomial in a root of \var{pol}.
 
 $\var{gal}[6]$ is the Galois group $G$ expressed as a vector of

 $\var{gal}[7]$ is a generating subset $S=[s_1,\ldots,s_g]$ of $G$

 $\var{gal}[8]$ contains the relative orders $[o_1,\ldots,o_g]$ of
 the generators of $S$ (\kbd{\var{gal}.orders}).
 
 Let $H_n$ be as above, we have the following properties:
 
 \quad\item if $G/H_n\simeq A_4$ then $[o_1,\ldots,o_g]$ ends by
 $[2,2,3]$.
 
 \quad\item if $G/H_n\simeq S_4$ then $[o_1,\ldots,o_g]$ ends by
 $[2,2,3,2]$.
 
 \quad\item for $1\leq i \leq g$ the subgroup of $G$ generated by
 $[s_1,\ldots,s_g]$ is normal, with the exception of $i=g-2$ in the
 $A_4$ case and of $i=g-3$ in the $S_A$ case.
 
 \quad\item the relative order $o_i$ of $s_i$ is its order in the
 quotient group $G/\langle s_1,\ldots,s_{i-1}\rangle$, with the same

 If flag is 2 output [pol,f] where pol is the polynomial and f the conductor.
Doc: computes the subextension
 of $\Q(\zeta_n)$ fixed by the subgroup $H \subset (\Z/n\Z)^*$. By the
 Kronecker-Weber theorem, all abelian number fields can be generated in this
 way (uniquely if $n$ is taken to be minimal).
 
 \noindent The pair $(n, H)$ is deduced from the parameters $(N, H)$ as follows
 
 \item $N$ an integer: then $n = N$; $H$ is a generator, i.e. an
 integer or an integer modulo $n$; or a vector of generators.
 
 \item $N$ the output of \kbd{znstar($n$)}. $H$ as in the first case
 above, or a matrix, taken to be a HNF left divisor of the SNF for $(\Z/n\Z)^*$
 (of type \kbd{$N$.cyc}), giving the generators of $H$ in terms of \kbd{$N$.gen}.
 
 \item $N$ the output of \kbd{bnrinit(bnfinit(y), $m$, 1)} where $m$ is a
 module. $H$ as in the first case, or a matrix taken to be a HNF left
 divisor of the SNF for the ray class group modulo $m$
 (of type \kbd{$N$.cyc}), giving the generators of $H$ in terms of \kbd{$N$.gen}.
 
 In this last case, beware that $H$ is understood relatively to $N$; in
 particular, if the infinite place does not divide the module, e.g if $m$ is
 an integer, then it is not a subgroup of $(\Z/n\Z)^*$, but of its quotient by
 $\{\pm 1\}$.
 
 If $fl=0$, compute a polynomial (in the variable \var{v}) defining the
 the subfield of $\Q(\zeta_n)$ fixed by the subgroup \var{H} of $(\Z/n\Z)^*$.
 
 If $fl=1$, compute only the conductor of the abelian extension, as a module.
 
 If $fl=2$, output $[pol, N]$, where $pol$ is the polynomial as output when
 $fl=0$ and $N$ the conductor as output when $fl=1$.
 
 The following function can be used to compute all subfields of
 $\Q(\zeta_n)$ (of exact degree \kbd{d}, if \kbd{d} is set):
 \bprog
 polsubcyclo(n, d = -1)=
 { my(bnr,L,IndexBound);
   IndexBound = if (d < 0, n, [d]);
   bnr = bnrinit(bnfinit(y), [n,[1]], 1);
   L = subgrouplist(bnr, IndexBound, 1);
   vector(#L,i, galoissubcyclo(bnr,L[i]));
 }
 @eprog\noindent
 Setting \kbd{L = subgrouplist(bnr, IndexBound)} would produce subfields of exact
 conductor $n\infty$.

 as for $\var{gal}.gen$ and $\var{gal}.orders$. Hence \var{gen} is a vector of
 permutations generating the subgroup, and \var{orders} is the relatives
 orders of the generators. The cardinal of a subgroup is the product of the
 relative orders. Such subgroup can be used instead of a Galois group in the
 following command: \kbd{galoisisabelian}, \kbd{galoissubgroups},
 \kbd{galoisexport} and \kbd{galoisidentify}.

Function: gcd
Class: basic
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: ggcd0
Prototype: GDG
Help: gcd(x,{y}): greatest common divisor of x and y.
Description: 
 (small, small):small   cgcd($1, $2)
 (int, int):int         gcdii($1, $2)
 (gen):gen              content($1)
 (gen, gen):gen         ggcd($1, $2)
Doc: creates the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y$.
 If you also need the $u$ and $v$ such that $x*u + y*v = \gcd(x,y)$,
 use the \tet{bezout} function. $x$ and $y$ can have rather quite general
 types, for instance both rational numbers. If $y$ is omitted and $x$ is a
 vector, returns the $\text{gcd}$ of all components of $x$, i.e.~this is
 equivalent to \kbd{content(x)}.
 
 When $x$ and $y$ are both given and one of them is a vector/matrix type,
 the GCD is again taken recursively on each component, but in a different way.
 If $y$ is a vector, resp.~matrix, then the result has the same type as $y$,
 and components equal to \kbd{gcd(x, y[i])}, resp.~\kbd{gcd(x, y[,i])}. Else
 if $x$ is a vector/matrix the result has the same type as $x$ and an
 analogous definition. Note that for these types, \kbd{gcd} is not
 commutative.
 
 The algorithm used is a naive \idx{Euclid} except for the following inputs:
 
 \item integers: use modified right-shift binary (``plus-minus''
 variant).
 
 \item univariate polynomials with coefficients in the same number
 field (in particular rational): use modular gcd algorithm.
 
 \item general polynomials: use the \idx{subresultant algorithm} if
 coefficient explosion is likely (non modular coefficients).
 
 If $u$ and $v$ are polynomials in the same variable with \emph{inexact}
 coefficients, their gcd is defined to be scalar, so that
 \bprog
 ? a = x + 0.0; gcd(a,a)
 %1 = 1
 ? b = y*x + O(y); gcd(b,b)
 %2 = y
 ? c = 4*x + O(2^3); gcd(c,c)
 %2 = 4
 @eprog\noindent A good quantitative check to decide whether such a
 gcd ``should be'' non-trivial, is to use \tet{polresultant}: a value
 close to $0$ means that a small deformation of the inputs has non-trivial gcd.
 You may also use \tet{bezout}, which does try to compute an approximate gcd
 $d$ and provides $u$, $v$ to check whether $u x + v y$ is close to $d$.
Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{ggcd}{GEN x, GEN y}, if \kbd{y} is not
 \kbd{NULL}, and \fun{GEN}{content}{GEN x}, if $\kbd{y} = \kbd{NULL}$.

 It is possible to omit $p$, in which case we take $p = 0$ if both $x$

 if one of $x$, $y$ is a \typ{INTMOD} modulo $q$ or a $q$-adic. (Incompatible

 @eprog\noindent
 This function cannot be used to add arbitrary $\Z$-modules, since it assumes
 that its arguments are ideals:
 \bprog
   ? b = Mat([1,0]~);
   ? idealadd(K, b, b)     \\ only square t_MATs represent ideals

 @eprog\noindent In the last two examples, we get wrong results since the
 matrices $c$ and $d$ do not correspond to an ideal : the $\Z$-span of their
 columns (as usual interpreted as coordinates with respect to the integer basis
 \kbd{K.zk}) is not an $O_K$-module. To add arbitrary $\Z$-modules generated

 Z_K, gives a vector of elements of the corresponding ideals who sum to 1.
 Otherwise, x and y are ideals, and if they sum up to 1, find one element in
 each of them such that the sum is 1.
Doc: $x$ and $y$ being two co-prime
 integral ideals (given in any form), this gives a two-component row vector
 $[a,b]$ such that $a\in x$, $b\in y$ and $a+b=1$.
 
 The alternative syntax $\kbd{idealaddtoone}(\var{nf},v)$, is supported, where
 $v$ is a $k$-component vector of ideals (given in any form) which sum to
 $\Z_K$. This outputs a $k$-component vector $e$ such that $e[i]\in x[i]$ for

 b such that v_p(b)=v_p(x) for all prime ideals p dividing x, and v_p(b)>=0
 for all other p. If (optional) flag is non-null x must be a prime ideal
 factorization with possibly zero exponents.
Doc: if $x$ is a fractional ideal
 (given in any form), gives an element $\alpha$ in $\var{nf}$ such that for
 all prime ideals $\goth{p}$ such that the valuation of $x$ at $\goth{p}$ is
 non-zero, we have $v_{\goth{p}}(\alpha)=v_{\goth{p}}(x)$, and
 $v_{\goth{p}}(\alpha)\ge0$ for all other $\goth{p}$.
 
 If $\fl$ is non-zero, $x$ must be given as a prime ideal factorization, as
 output by \kbd{idealfactor}, but possibly with zero or negative exponents.
 This yields an element $\alpha$ such that for all prime ideals $\goth{p}$
 occurring in $x$, $v_{\goth{p}}(\alpha)$ is equal to the exponent of
 $\goth{p}$ in $x$, and for all other prime ideals,
 $v_{\goth{p}}(\alpha)\ge0$. This generalizes $\kbd{idealappr}(\var{nf},x,0)$
 since zero exponents are allowed. Note that the algorithm used is slightly
 different, so that

Doc: $x$ being a prime ideal factorization
 (i.e.~a 2 by 2 matrix whose first column contains prime ideals, and the second
 column integral exponents), $y$ a vector of elements in $\var{nf}$ indexed by
 the ideals in $x$, computes an element $b$ such that

 If $\fl$ is non-zero, the quotient $x \cdot y^{-1}$ is assumed to be an
 integral ideal. This can be much faster when the norm of the quotient is
 small even though the norms of $x$ and $y$ are large.

 flag is non-zero, perform idealred along the way.
Doc: gives back the ideal corresponding to a factorization. The integer $1$
 corresponds to the empty factorization.
 If $e$ is present, $e$ and $f$ must be vectors of the same length ($e$ being
 integral), and the corresponding factorization is the product of the
 $f[i]^{e[i]}$.
 
 If not, and $f$ is vector, it is understood as in the preceding case with $e$
 a vector of 1s: we return the product of the $f[i]$. Finally, $f$ can be a
 regular factorization, as produced by \kbd{idealfactor}.

 If \kbd{flag} is non-zero, perform ideal reductions (\tet{idealred}) along the
 way. This is most useful if the ideals involved are all \emph{extended}
 ideals (for instance with trivial principal part), so that the principal parts
 extracted by \kbd{idealred} are not lost. Here is an example:

 useful to reduce general modules to the canonical form once in a while:

 is the $\Z_K$-module they generate,
 
 \item if $N$ or more are given, it is \emph{assumed} that they form a

 The result is a vector of \tev{prid} structures, each representing one of the
 prime ideals above $p$ in the number field $\var{nf}$. The representation
 $\kbd{pr}=[p,a,e,f,b]$ of a prime ideal means the following: $a$ and $b$ are
 algebraic integers in the maximal order $\Z_K$; the prime ideal is
 equal to $\goth{p} = p\Z_K + a\Z_K$;
 $e$ is the ramification index; $f$ is the residual index;
 and $b$ is such that $\goth{p}^{-1}=\Z_K+ b/ p\Z_K$, which is used internally
 to compute valuations. The algebraic number $a$ is guaranteed to have a
 valuation equal to 1 at the prime ideal (this is automatic if $e>1$).

Doc: \idx{LLL} reduction of

 The $v$ parameter is best left omitted, but if it is present, it must
 be an $\kbd{nf.r1} + \kbd{nf.r2}$-component vector of \emph{non-negative}
 integers. (What counts is the relative magnitude of the entries: if all
 entries are equal, the effect is the same as if the vector had been omitted.)
 
 This function finds a ``small'' $a$ in $I$ (see the end for technical details).
 The result is the Hermite normal form of
 the ``reduced'' ideal $J = r I/a$, where $r$ is the unique rational number such
 that $J$ is integral and primitive. (This is usually not a reduced ideal in
 the sense of \idx{Buchmann}.)

 @eprog\noindent More often than not, a \idx{principal ideal} yields the unit
 ideal as above. This is a quick and dirty way to check if ideals are principal,
 but it is not a necessary condition: a non-trivial result does not prove that
 the ideal is non-principal. For guaranteed results, see \kbd{bnfisprincipal},
 which requires the computation of a full \kbd{bnf} structure.
 
 If the input is an extended ideal $[I,s]$, the output is $[J,sa/r]$; this way,
 one can keep track of the principal ideal part:
 \bprog
 ? idealred(K, [P, 1])
 %5 = [[1, 0; 0, 1], [-2, 1]~]
 @eprog\noindent
 meaning that $P$ is generated by $[-2, 1]~$. The number field element in the
 extended part is an algebraic number in any form \emph{or} a factorization
 matrix (in terms of number field elements, not ideals!). In the latter case,
 elements stay in factored form, which is a convenient way to avoid
 coefficient explosion; see also \tet{idealpow}.
 
 \misctitle{Technical note} The routine computes an LLL-reduced
 basis for the lattice $I$ equipped with the quadratic form
 $$|| x ||_v^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{r_1+r_2} 2^{v_i}\varepsilon_i|\sigma_i(x)|^2,$$
 where as usual the $\sigma_i$ are the (real and) complex embeddings and
 $\varepsilon_i = 1$, resp.~$2$, for a real, resp.~complex place. The element
 $a$ is simply the first vector in the LLL basis. The only reason you may want
 to try to change some directions and set some $v_i\neq 0$ is to randomize
 the elements found for a fixed ideal, which is heuristically useful in index
 calculus algorithms like \tet{bnfinit} and \tet{bnfisprincipal}.
 
 \misctitle{Even more technical note} In fact, the above is a white lie.
 We do not use $||\cdot||_v$ exactly but a rescaled rounded variant which
 gets us faster and simpler LLLs. There's no harm since we are not using any
 theoretical property of $a$ after all, except that it belongs to $I$ and is
 ``expected to be small''.

 such that v[1] is the order (i.e. eulerphi(I)), v[2] is a vector of cyclic
 components, and v[3] is a vector giving the corresponding generators. If
 flag=1 (default), gives idealstarinit, i.e. a 6-component vector
 [I,v,fa,f2,U,V] where v is as above without the generators, fa is the prime
 ideal factorisation of I and f2, U and V are technical but essential to work
 in (Z_K/I)^*. Finally if flag=2, same as with flag=1 except that the
 generators are also given.
Doc: outputs a \var{bid} structure,
 necessary for computing in the finite abelian group $G = (\Z_K/I)^*$. Here,
 \var{nf} is a number field and $I$ is a \var{modulus}: either an ideal in any
 form, or a row vector whose first component is an ideal and whose second
 component is a row vector of $r_1$ 0 or 1.
 
 This \var{bid} is used in \tet{ideallog} to compute discrete logarithms. It
 also contains useful information which can be conveniently retrieved as
 \kbd{\var{bid}.mod} (the modulus),
 \kbd{\var{bid}.clgp} ($G$ as a finite abelian group),
 \kbd{\var{bid}.no} (the cardinality of $G$),
 \kbd{\var{bid}.cyc} (elementary divisors) and
 \kbd{\var{bid}.gen} (generators).
 
 If $\fl=1$ (default), the result is a \var{bid} structure without
 generators.
 
 If $\fl=2$, as $\fl=1$, but including generators, which wastes some time.
 
 If $\fl=0$, only outputs $(\Z_K/I)^*$ as an abelian group,
 i.e as a 3-component vector $[h,d,g]$: $h$ is the order, $d$ is the vector of
 SNF\sidx{Smith normal form} cyclic components and $g$ the corresponding
 generators.
Variant: Instead the above hardcoded numerical flags, one should rather use
 \fun{GEN}{Idealstar}{GEN nf, GEN ideal, long flag}, where \kbd{flag} is
 an or-ed combination of \tet{nf_GEN} (include generators) and \tet{nf_INIT}

 one more combination: gen, but no init.

Doc: computes a two-element
 representation of the ideal $x$ in the number field $\var{nf}$, combining a
 random search and an explicit approximation theorem. $x$ is an ideal

 $x=a\Z_K+\alpha\Z_K$ and $a\in\Z$, where $a$ is the one passed as argument if
 any. Unless $x$ was given as a principal ideal, $a$ is chosen to be the
 positive generator of $x\cap\Z$.
 
 Note that when an explicit $a$ is given, we must factor it and this may
 be costly. When $a$ is omitted, we use a fast lazy factorization of $x\cap
 \Z$, yielding an algorithm in randomized polynomial time (and generally
 much faster in practice).

 Note that the boolean operators \kbd{\&\&} and \kbd{||} are evaluated
 according to operator precedence as explained in \secref{se:operators}, but
 that, contrary to other operators, the evaluation of the arguments is stopped

 two PARI integers, and is not directly accessible under \kbd{gp} (it is
 eventually called by the \kbd{+} operator of course):

 Re-installing a function will print a warning and update the prototype code
 if needed. However, it will not reload a symbol from the library, even it the
 latter has been recompiled.
 
 \misctitle{Caution} This function may not work on all systems, especially
 when \kbd{gp} has been compiled statically. In that case, the first use of an
 installed function will provoke a Segmentation Fault, i.e.~a major internal

 of \var{expr} on $]a,b[$ with respect to $X$. The integrand may have values
 belonging to a vector space over the real numbers; in particular, it can be
 complex-valued or vector-valued. But it is assumed that the function is regular
 on $]a,b[$. If the endpoints $a$ and $b$ are finite and the function is regular
 there, the situation is simple:
 \bprog

 then using \kbd{+oo}, \kbd{-oo}, \kbd{-INFINITY}, etc. will have the expected
 behavior.

   ***                 ^--------------------
   *** exp: exponent (expo) overflow
 @eprog\noindent
 We shall see in a moment how to avoid the last problem, after describing
 the last argument \var{tab}, which is both optional and technical. The
 routine uses weights, which are mostly independent of the function being
 integrated, evaluated at many sampling points. If \var{tab} is
 
 \item a positive integer $m$, we use $2^m$ sampling points, hopefully
 increasing accuracy. But note that the running time is roughly proportional
 to $2^m$. One may try consecutive values of $m$ until they give the same
 value up to an accepted error. If \var{tab} is omitted, the algorithm guesses
 a reasonable value for $m$ depending on the current precision only, which
 should be sufficient for regular functions. That value may be obtained from
 \tet{intnumstep}, and increased in case of difficulties.
 
 \item a set of integration tables as output by \tet{intnuminit},
 they are used directly. This is useful if several integrations of the same
 type are performed (on the same kind of interval and functions, for a given
 accuracy), in particular for multivariate integrals, since we then skip
 expensive precomputations.
 
 \misctitle{Specifying the behavior at endpoints}
 This is done as follows. An endpoint $a$ is either given as such (a scalar,
 real or complex, or $[\pm1]$ for $\pm\infty$), or as a two component vector
 $[a,\alpha]$, to indicate the behavior of the integrand in a neighborhood
 of $a$.
 
 If $a$ is finite, the code $[a,\alpha]$ means the function has a
 singularity of the form $(x-a)^{\alpha}$, up to logarithms. (If $\alpha \ge
 0$, we only assume the function is regular, which is the default assumption.)
 If a wrong singularity exponent is used, the result will lose a catastrophic
 number of decimals:
 \bprog
 ? intnum(x=0, 1, x^(-1/2))         \\@com assume $x^{-1/2}$ is regular at 0

 %3 = 1.999999999999999999999946438 \\@com using a wrong exponent is bad
 @eprog
 
 If $a$ is $\pm\infty$, which is coded as $[\pm 1]$, the situation is more
 complicated, and $[[\pm1],\alpha]$ means:
 
 \item $\alpha=0$ (or no $\alpha$ at all, i.e. simply $[\pm1]$) assumes that the
 integrand tends to zero, but not exponentially fast, and not
 oscillating such as $\sin(x)/x$.
 
 \item $\alpha>0$ assumes that the function tends to zero exponentially fast
 approximately as $\exp(-\alpha x)$. This includes oscillating but quickly
 decreasing functions such as $\exp(-x)\sin(x)$.

 \item $\alpha<-1$ assumes that the function tends to $0$ slowly, like
 $x^{\alpha}$. Here it is essential to give the correct $\alpha$, if possible,
 but on the other hand $\alpha\le -2$ is equivalent to $\alpha=0$, in other
 words to no $\alpha$ at all.
 
 \smallskip The last two codes are reserved for oscillating functions.
 Let $k > 0$ real, and $g(x)$ a non-oscillating function tending slowly to $0$
 (e.g. like a negative power of $x$), then
 
 \item $\alpha=k * I$ assumes that the function behaves like $\cos(kx)g(x)$.
 
 \item $\alpha=-k* I$ assumes that the function behaves like $\sin(kx)g(x)$.
 
 \noindent Here it is critical to give the exact value of $k$. If the
 oscillating part is not a pure sine or cosine, one must expand it into a
 Fourier series, use the above codings, and sum the resulting contributions.
 Otherwise you will get nonsense. Note that $\cos(kx)$, and similarly
 $\sin(kx)$, means that very function, and not a translated version such as
 $\cos(kx+a)$.
 
 \misctitle{Note} If $f(x)=\cos(kx)g(x)$ where $g(x)$ tends to zero
 exponentially fast as $\exp(-\alpha x)$, it is up to the user to choose
 between $[[\pm1],\alpha]$ and $[[\pm1],k* I]$, but a good rule of thumb is that
 if the oscillations are much weaker than the exponential decrease, choose
 $[[\pm1],\alpha]$, otherwise choose $[[\pm1],k* I]$, although the latter can
 reasonably be used in all cases, while the former cannot. To take a specific
 example, in the inverse Mellin transform, the integrand is almost always a
 product of an exponentially decreasing and an oscillating factor. If we
 choose the oscillating type of integral we perhaps obtain the best results,
 at the expense of having to recompute our functions for a different value of
 the variable $z$ giving the transform, preventing us to use a function such
 as \kbd{intmellininvshort}. On the other hand using the exponential type of
 integral, we obtain less accurate results, but we skip expensive
 recomputations. See \kbd{intmellininvshort} and \kbd{intfuncinit} for more
 explanations.

 For example:

 Note the formula
 $$ \int_0^\infty \sin(x)/x^s\,dx = \cos(\pi s/2) \Gamma(1-s)\;, $$
 a priori valid only for $0 < \Re(s) < 2$, but the right hand side provides an
 analytic continuation which may be evaluated at $s = -2$\dots
 
 \misctitle{Multivariate integration}
 Using successive univariate integration with respect to different formal
 parameters, it is immediate to do naive multivariate integration. But it is
 important to use a suitable \kbd{intnuminit} to precompute data for the
 \emph{internal} integrations at least!
 
 For example, to compute the double integral on the unit disc $x^2+y^2\le1$
 of the function $x^2+y^2$, we can write

C-Name: intnuminit
Prototype: GGD0,L,p
Help: intnuminit(a,b,{m=0}): initialize tables for integrations from a to b.
 See help for intnum for coding of a and b. Possible types: compact interval,
 semi-compact (one extremity at + or - infinity) or R, and very slowly, slowly
 or exponentially decreasing, or sine or cosine oscillating at infinities.
Doc: initialize tables for integration from
 $a$ to $b$, where $a$ and $b$ are coded as in \kbd{intnum}. Only the
 compactness, the possible existence of singularities, the speed of decrease
 or the oscillations at infinity are taken into account, and not the values.
 For instance {\tt intnuminit(-1,1)} is equivalent to {\tt intnuminit(0,Pi)},
 and {\tt intnuminit([0,-1/2],[1])} is equivalent to {\tt
 intnuminit([-1],[-1,-1/2])}. If $m$ is not given, it is computed according to
 the current precision. Otherwise the integration step is $1/2^m$. Reasonable
 values of $m$ are $m=6$ or $m=7$ for $100$ decimal digits, and $m=9$ for
 $1000$ decimal digits.
 
 The result is technical, but in some cases it is useful to know the output.
 Let $x=\phi(t)$ be the change of variable which is used. \var{tab}[1] contains
 the integer $m$ as above, either given by the user or computed from the default
 precision, and can be recomputed directly using the function \kbd{intnumstep}.
 \var{tab}[2] and \var{tab}[3] contain respectively the abscissa and weight
 corresponding to $t=0$ ($\phi(0)$ and $\phi'(0)$). \var{tab}[4] and
 \var{tab}[5] contain the abscissas and weights corresponding to positive
 $t=nh$ for $1\le n\le N$ and $h=1/2^m$ ($\phi(nh)$ and $\phi'(nh)$). Finally
 \var{tab}[6] and \var{tab}[7] contain either the abscissas and weights
 corresponding to negative $t=nh$ for $-N\le n\le -1$, or may be empty (but
 not always) if $\phi(t)$ is an odd function (implicitly we would have
 $\var{tab}[6]=-\var{tab}[4]$ and $\var{tab}[7]=\var{tab}[5]$).

Help: intnumromb(X=a,b,expr,{flag=0}): numerical integration of expr (smooth in

 expr can be evaluated exactly on [a,b]; 1: general function; 2: a or b can be

 limits at a or b.
Wrapper: (,,G)
Description: 
  (gen,gen,gen,?small):gen:prec intnumromb(${3 cookie}, ${3 wrapper}, $1, $2, $4, prec)
Doc: numerical integration of
 \var{expr} (smooth in $]a,b[$), with respect to $X$. This function is
 deprecated, use \tet{intnum} instead.
 
 Set $\fl=0$ (or omit it altogether) when $a$ and $b$ are not too large, the
 function is smooth, and can be evaluated exactly everywhere on the interval
 $[a,b]$.
 
 If $\fl=1$, uses a general driver routine for doing numerical integration,
 making no particular assumption (slow).
 
 $\fl=2$ is tailored for being used when $a$ or $b$ are infinite. One
 \emph{must} have $ab>0$, and in fact if for example $b=+\infty$, then it is
 preferable to have $a$ as large as possible, at least $a\ge1$.
 
 If $\fl=3$, the function is allowed to be undefined (but continuous) at $a$
 or $b$, for example the function $\sin(x)/x$ at $x=0$.
 
 The user should not require too much accuracy: 18 or 28 decimal digits is OK,
 but not much more. In addition, analytical cleanup of the integral must have
 been done: there must be no singularities in the interval or at the
 boundaries. In practice this can be accomplished with a simple change of
 variable. Furthermore, for improper integrals, where one or both of the
 limits of integration are plus or minus infinity, the function must decrease
 sufficiently rapidly at infinity. This can often be accomplished through
 integration by parts. Finally, the function to be integrated should not be
 very small (compared to the current precision) on the entire interval. This
 can of course be accomplished by just multiplying by an appropriate constant.
 
 Note that \idx{infinity} can be represented with essentially no loss of
 accuracy by 1e1000. However beware of real underflow when dealing with
 rapidly decreasing functions. For example, if one wants to compute the
 $\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2}\,dx$ to 28 decimal digits, then one should set
 infinity equal to 10 for example, and certainly not to 1e1000.

Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: isprime(x,{flag=0}): true(1) if x is a (proven) prime number, false(0)
 if not. If flag is 0 or omitted, use a combination of algorithms. If flag is
 1, the primality is certified by the Pocklington-Lehmer Test. If flag is 2,
 the primality is certified using the APRCL test.
Description: 
 (int, ?0):bool        isprime($1)
 (int, 1):bool         plisprime($1, 0)
 (int, 2):gen          plisprime($1, 1)
 (gen, ?small):gen     gisprime($1, $2)
Doc: true (1) if $x$ is a prime
 number, false (0) otherwise. A prime number is a positive integer having
 exactly two distinct divisors among the natural numbers, namely 1 and
 itself.
 
 This routine proves or disproves rigorously that a number is prime, which can
 be very slow when $x$ is indeed prime and has more than $1000$ digits, say.
 Use \tet{ispseudoprime} to quickly check for compositeness. See also
 \kbd{factor}. It accepts vector/matrices arguments, and is then applied
 componentwise.
 
 If $\fl=0$, use a combination of Baillie-PSW pseudo primality test (see
 \tet{ispseudoprime}), Selfridge ``$p-1$'' test if $x-1$ is smooth enough, and
 Adleman-Pomerance-Rumely-Cohen-Lenstra (APRCL) for general $x$.
 
 If $\fl=1$, use Selfridge-Pocklington-Lehmer ``$p-1$'' test and output a
 primality certificate as follows: return
 
 \item 0 if $x$ is composite,
 
 \item 1 if $x$ is small enough that passing Baillie-PSW test guarantees
 its primality (currently $x < 2^{64}$, as checked by Jan Feitsma),
 
 \item $2$ if $x$ is a large prime whose primality could only sensibly be
 proven (given the algorithms implemented in PARI) using the APRCL test.
 
 \item Otherwise ($x$ is large and $x-1$ is smooth) output a three column
 matrix as a primality certificate. The first column contains prime
 divisors $p$ of $x-1$ (such that $\prod p^{v_p(x-1)} > x^{1/3}$), the second
 the corresponding elements $a_p$ as in Proposition~8.3.1 in GTM~138 , and the
 third the output of isprime(p,1).
 
 The algorithm fails if one of the pseudo-prime factors is not prime, which is
 exceedingly unlikely and well worth a bug report. Note that if you monitor
 \kbd{isprime} at a high enough debug level, you may see warnings about
 untested integers being declared primes. This is normal: we ask for partial
 factorisations (sufficient to prove primality if the unfactored part is not
 too large), and \kbd{factor} warns us that the cofactor hasn't been tested.
 It may or may not be tested later, and may or may not be prime. This does
 not affect the validity of the whole \kbd{isprime} procedure.
 
 If $\fl=2$, use APRCL.

Doc: true (1) if $x$ is a strong pseudo
 prime (see below), false (0) otherwise. If this function returns false, $x$
 is not prime; if, on the other hand it returns true, it is only highly likely
 that $x$ is a prime number. Use \tet{isprime} (which is of course much
 slower) to prove that $x$ is indeed prime.
 The function accepts vector/matrices arguments, and is then applied
 componentwise.
 
 If $\fl = 0$, checks whether $x$ is a Baillie-Pomerance-Selfridge-Wagstaff
 pseudo prime (strong Rabin-Miller pseudo prime for base $2$, followed by
 strong Lucas test for the sequence $(P,-1)$, $P$ smallest positive integer
 such that $P^2 - 4$ is not a square mod $x$).
 
 There are no known composite numbers passing this test, although it is
 expected that infinitely many such numbers exist. In particular, all
 composites $\leq 2^{64}$ are correctly detected (checked using
 \kbd{http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/Pseudoprimes/index-2-to-64.html}).
 
 If $\fl > 0$, checks whether $x$ is a strong Miller-Rabin pseudo prime  for
 $\fl$ randomly chosen bases (with end-matching to catch square roots of $-1$).

 If the symbol is associated to a variable --- user functions being an

 \kbd{a = 'a} to reset variables to their starting values. However, this
 will not delete a help message associated to \kbd{a}, and is also slightly
 slower than \kbd{kill(a)}.

 When $x$ and $y$ are both given and one of them is a vector/matrix type,
 the LCM is again taken recursively on each component, but in a different way.
 If $y$ is a vector, resp.~matrix, then the result has the same type as $y$,
 and components equal to \kbd{lcm(x, y[i])}, resp.~\kbd{lcm(x, y[,i])}. Else
 if $x$ is a vector/matrix the result has the same type as $x$ and an

 a wide sense: It is admissible to compare objects of different types

 as vectors/matrices of different lengths. The comparison is recursive.
 
 In case all components are equal up to the smallest length of the operands,
 the more complex is considered to be larger. More precisely, the longest is
 the largest; when lengths are equal, we have matrix $>$ vector $>$ scalar.

 If $x$ is $p$-adic, $\fl$ is meaningless and the algorithm LLL-reduces a
 suitable (dual) lattice.
 
 Otherwise, the value of $\fl$ determines the algorithm used; in the current
 version of PARI, we suggest to use \emph{non-negative} values, since it is by
 far the fastest and most robust implementation. See the detailed example in
 \secref{se:algdep} (\kbd{algdep}).
 
 If $\fl\geq 0$, uses a floating point (variable precision) LLL algorithm.
 This is in general much faster than the other variants.
 If $\fl = 0$ the accuracy is chosen internally using a crude heuristic.
 If $\fl > 0$ the computation is done with an accuracy of $\fl$ decimal digits.
 To get meaningful results in the latter case, the parameter $\fl$ should be
 smaller than the number of correct decimal digits in the input.
 
 If $\fl=-1$, uses a variant of the \idx{LLL} algorithm due to Hastad,
 Lagarias and Schnorr (STACS 1986). If the precision is too low, the routine
 may enter an infinite loop. Faster than the alternatives if it converges,
 especially when the accuracy is much larger than what is really necessary;
 usually diverges, though.
 
 If $\fl=-2$, $x$ is allowed to be (and in any case interpreted as) a matrix.
 Returns a non trivial element of the kernel of $x$, or $0$ if $x$ has trivial
 kernel. The element is defined over the field of coefficients of $x$, and is
 in general not integral.
 
 If $\fl=-3$, uses the PSLQ algorithm. This may return a real number $B$,
 indicating that the input accuracy was exhausted and that no relation exist
 whose sup norm is less than $B$.
 
 If $\fl=-4$, uses an experimental 2-level PSLQ, which does not work at all.
 Don't use it!
Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{lindep}{GEN x} ($\fl=0$)
 \fun{GEN}{lindep2}{GEN x, long bit} ($\fl\geq 0$, bypasses the check for

Doc: inserts the object $x$ at
 position $n$ in $L$ (which must be of type \typ{LIST}). This has
 complexity $O(\#L - n + 1)$: all the
 remaining elements of \var{list} (from position $n+1$ onwards) are shifted
 to the right.

Description:

Doc: 
 removes the $n$-th element of the list
 \var{list} (which must be of type \typ{LIST}). If $n$ is omitted,
 or greater than the list current length, removes the last element.
 This runs in time $O(\#L - n + 1)$.

Function: listput

C-Name: listput
Prototype: WGD0,L,
Help: listput(list,x,{n}): sets n-th element of list equal to x. If n is

Description:

Doc: 
 sets the $n$-th element of the list
 \var{list} (which must be of type \typ{LIST}) equal to $x$. If $n$ is omitted,
 or greater than the list length, appends $x$.
 You may put an element into an occupied cell (not changing the
 list length), but it is easier to use the standard \kbd{list[n] = x}
 construct. This runs in time $O(\#L)$ in the worst case (when the list must
 be reallocated), but in time $O(1)$ on average: any number of successive
 \kbd{listput}s run in time $O(\#L)$, where $\#L$ denotes the list

Doc: sorts the \typ{LIST} \var{list} in place. If $\fl$ is non-zero,
 suppresses all repeated coefficients. This is faster than the \kbd{vecsort}

Function: log
Class: basic
Section: transcendental
C-Name: glog
Prototype: Gp
Help: log(x): natural logarithm of x.
Description: 
 (gen):gen:prec        glog($1, prec)
Doc: principal branch of the natural logarithm of
 $x \in \C^*$, i.e.~such that $\text{Im(log}(x))\in{} ]-\pi,\pi]$.
 The branch cut lies
 along the negative real axis, continuous with quadrant 2, i.e.~such that
 $\lim_{b\to 0^+} \log (a+bi) = \log a$ for $a \in\R^*$. The result is complex
 (with imaginary part equal to $\pi$) if $x\in \R$ and $x < 0$. In general,
 the algorithm uses the formula
 $$\log(x) \approx {\pi\over 2\text{agm}(1, 4/s)} - m \log 2, $$
 if $s = x 2^m$ is large enough. (The result is exact to $B$ bits provided
 $s > 2^{B/2}$.) At low accuracies, the series expansion near $1$ is used.
 
 $p$-adic arguments are also accepted for $x$, with the convention that
 $\log(p)=0$. Hence in particular $\exp(\log(x))/x$ is not in general equal to
 1 but to a $(p-1)$-th root of unity (or $\pm1$ if $p=2$) times a power of $p$.
Variant: For a \typ{PADIC} $x$, the function
 \fun{GEN}{Qp_log}{GEN x} is also available.

 uses a slower division-free algorithm.
Doc: 
 \idx{adjoint matrix} of $x$, i.e.~the matrix $y$
 of cofactors of $x$, satisfying $x*y=\det(x)*\Id$. $x$ must be a
 (non-necessarily invertible) square matrix of dimension $n$.
 If $\fl$ is 0 or omitted, use a fast algorithm which assumes that $n!$ is
 invertible. If $\fl$ is 1, use a slower division-free algorithm.

C-Name: det0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: matdet(x,{flag=0}): determinant of the matrix x using Gauss-Bareiss.
 If (optional) flag is set to 1, use classical Gaussian elimination (slightly
 better for integer entries).
Description:

Doc: determinant of $x$. $x$ must be a square matrix.
 
 If $\fl=0$, uses Gauss-Bareiss.
 
 If $\fl=1$, uses classical Gaussian elimination, which is better when the
 entries of the matrix are reals or integers for example, but usually much
 worse for more complicated entries like multivariate polynomials.
Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{det}{GEN x} ($\fl=0$) and
 \fun{GEN}{det2}{GEN x} ($\fl=1$).

Function: matdetint
Class: basic
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: detint
Prototype: G
Help: matdetint(x): some multiple of the determinant of the lattice
 generated by the columns of x (0 if not of maximal rank). Useful with
 mathnfmod.
Doc: 
 $x$ being an $m\times n$ matrix with integer
 coefficients, this function computes a non-zero \emph{multiple} of the
 determinant of
 the lattice generated by the columns of $x$ if it has maximal rank $m$, and
 returns zero otherwise, using the Gauss-Bareiss algorithm. When $x$ is square,
 the exact determinant is obtained.
 
 This function is useful in conjunction with \kbd{mathnfmod}, which needs to
 know such a multiple. If the rank is maximal and the matrix non-square,
 you can obtain the exact determinant using
 \bprog
   matdet( mathnfmod(x, matdetint(x)) )
 @eprog\noindent
 Note that as soon as one of the dimensions gets large ($m$ or $n$ is larger
 than 20, say), it will often be much faster to use \kbd{mathnf(x, 1)} or
 \kbd{mathnf(x, 4)} directly.

 polynomials in the variable v. If flag is 2, return a two-components vector
 [F,B] where F is the Frobenius form and B is the basis change so that
 M=B^-1*F*B.
Doc: returns the Frobenius form of
 the square matrix \kbd{M}. If $\fl=1$, returns only the elementary divisors as
 a vector of polynomials in the variable \kbd{v}.  If $\fl=2$, returns a
 two-components vector [F,B] where \kbd{F} is the Frobenius form and \kbd{B} is

 \idx{Hilbert matrix}of order $x$, i.e.~the matrix whose coefficient
 ($i$,$j$) is $1/ (i+j-1)$.

Function: mathnf
Class: basic
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: mathnf0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: mathnf(x,{flag=0}): (upper triangular) Hermite normal form of x, basis
 for the lattice formed by the columns of x. flag is optional whose value
 range from 0 to 4 (0 if omitted), meaning : 0: naive algorithm. 1: as 0, but
 output 2-component vector [H,U] such that H is the HNF of
 x, and U is a unimodular matrix such that XU=H. 3: Batut's algorithm:
 output [H,U,P] where P is a permutation matrix such that P x U = H. 4:
 as 1, using a heuristic variant of LLL reduction along the way.
Doc: if $x$ is a (not necessarily square)
 matrix with integer entries, finds the \emph{upper triangular}
 \idx{Hermite normal form} of $x$. If the rank of $x$ is equal to its number
 of rows, the result is a square matrix. In general, the columns of the result
 form a basis of the lattice spanned by the columns of $x$.
 
 If $\fl=0$, uses the naive algorithm. This is in general fastest but may
 require too much memory as the dimension gets large (bigger than 100, say),
 in which case you may try \kbd{mathnfmod(x, matdetint(x))} when $x$ has
 maximal rank, and \kbd{mathnf(x, 4)} otherwise.
 
 If $\fl=1$, outputs a two-component row vector $[H,U]$, where $H$ is the
 Hermite normal form of $x$ defined as above,  and $U$ is the
 unimodular transformation matrix such that $xU=[0|H]$. When the kernel is
 large, $U$ has in general huge coefficients. In the worst case, the
 running time is exponential with respect to the dimension, but the
 routine behaves well in small dimension (less than 50 or 100, say).
 
 If $\fl=3$, uses Batut's algorithm and output $[H,U,P]$, such that $H$ and
 $U$ are as before and $P$ is a permutation of the rows such that $P$ applied
 to $xU$ gives $H$. This is in general slower than $\fl=1$ but the matrix $U$
 is smaller; it may still be large.
 
 If $\fl=4$, as in case 1 above, but uses a variant of \idx{LLL}
 reduction along the way. The matrix $U$ is in general close to optimal (in
 terms of smallest $L_2$ norm), but the reduction is in general slow,
 although provably polynomial-time.
Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{hnf}{GEN x} ($\fl=0$) and
 \fun{GEN}{hnfall}{GEN x} ($\fl=1$). To reduce \emph{huge} (say $400 \times
 400$ and more) relation matrices (sparse with small entries), you can use
 the pair \kbd{hnfspec} / \kbd{hnfadd}. Since this is quite technical and
 the calling interface may change, they are not documented yet. Look at the
 code in \kbd{basemath/alglin1.c}.

Function: mathnfmod

C-Name: hnfmod
Prototype: GG
Help: mathnfmod(x,d): (upper triangular) Hermite normal form of x, basis for

 non-zero determinant of this lattice.
Doc: if $x$ is a (not necessarily square) matrix of
 maximal rank with integer entries, and $d$ is a multiple of the (non-zero)
 determinant of the lattice spanned by the columns of $x$, finds the
 \emph{upper triangular} \idx{Hermite normal form} of $x$.
 
 If the rank of $x$ is equal to its number of rows, the result is a square
 matrix. In general, the columns of the result form a basis of the lattice
 spanned by the columns of $x$. Even when $d$ is known, this is in general
 slower than \kbd{mathnf} but uses much less memory.

C-Name: matimage0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: matimage(x,{flag=0}): basis of the image of the matrix x. flag is

Doc: gives a basis for the image of the
 matrix $x$ as columns of a matrix. A priori the matrix can have entries of
 any type. If $\fl=0$, use standard Gauss pivot. If $\fl=1$, use
 \kbd{matsupplement} (much slower: keep the default flag!).

 \typ{VECSMALL} components $y$ and $z$ of length $r$ giving a list of rows

 number of rows each of whose columns are independent, finds a basis of the
 $\Q$-vector space equal to the intersection of the spaces spanned by the
 columns of $x$ and $y$ respectively. The faster function
 \tet{idealintersect} can be used to intersect fractional ideals (projective
 $\Z_K$ modules of rank $1$); the slower but much more general function
 \tet{nfhnf} can be used to intersect general $\Z_K$-modules.

Function: matsize
Class: basic
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: matsize
Prototype: G
Help: matsize(x): number of rows and columns of the vector/matrix x as a
 2-vector.
Doc: $x$ being a vector or matrix, returns a row vector
 with two components, the first being the number of rows (1 for a row vector),
 the second the number of columns (1 for a column vector).

Function: matsnf
Class: basic
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: matsnf0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: matsnf(X,{flag=0}): Smith normal form (i.e. elementary divisors) of
 the matrix X, expressed as a vector d. Binary digits of flag mean 1: returns
 [u,v,d] where d=u*X*v, otherwise only the diagonal d is returned, 2: allow
 polynomial entries, otherwise assume X is integral, 4: removes all
 information corresponding to entries equal to 1 in d.
Doc: if $X$ is a (singular or non-singular) matrix outputs the vector of
 \idx{elementary divisors} of $X$, i.e.~the diagonal of the
 \idx{Smith normal form} of $X$, normalized so that $d_n \mid d_{n-1} \mid
 \ldots \mid d_1$.
 
 The binary digits of \fl\ mean:
 
 1 (complete output): if set, outputs $[U,V,D]$, where $U$ and $V$ are two
 unimodular matrices such that $UXV$ is the diagonal matrix $D$. Otherwise
 output only the diagonal of $D$. If $X$ is not a square matrix, then $D$
 will be a square diagonal matrix padded with zeros on the left or the top.
 
 2 (generic input): if set, allows polynomial entries, in which case the
 input matrix must be square. Otherwise, assume that $X$ has integer
 coefficients with arbitrary shape.
 
 4 (cleanup): if set, cleans up the output. This means that elementary
 divisors equal to $1$ will be deleted, i.e.~outputs a shortened vector $D'$
 instead of $D$. If complete output was required, returns $[U',V',D']$ so
 that $U'XV' = D'$ holds. If this flag is set, $X$ is allowed to be of the
 form `vector of elementary divisors' or $[U,V,D]$ as would normally be output with the cleanup flag
 unset.

 column vector, gives a small integer solution to the system of congruences
 $\sum_i m_{i,j}x_j\equiv b_i\pmod{d_i}$ if one exists, otherwise returns

 in which case all the $b_i$ (resp.~$d_i$) above are taken to be equal to $B$
 (resp.~$D$).

 @eprog
 If $\fl=1$, all solutions are returned in the form of a two-component row
 vector $[x,u]$, where $x$ is a small integer solution to the system of
 congruences and $u$ is a matrix whose columns give a basis of the homogeneous
 system (so that all solutions can be obtained by adding $x$ to any linear
 combination of columns of $u$). If no solution exists, returns zero.

Function: modreverse

C-Name: modreverse

Help: modreverse(z): reverse polmod of the polmod z, if it exists.
Doc: let $z = \kbd{Mod(A, T)}$ be a polmod, and $Q$ be its minimal
 polynomial, which must satisfy $\text{deg}(Q) = \text{deg}(T)$.
 Returns a ``reverse polmod'' \kbd{Mod(B, Q)}, which is a root of $T$.
 
 This is quite useful when one changes the generating element in algebraic
 extensions:
 \bprog
 ? u = Mod(x, x^3 - x -1); v = u^5;
 ? w = modreverse(v)
 %2 = Mod(x^2 - 4*x + 1, x^3 - 5*x^2 + 4*x - 1)

 which means that $x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x -1$ is another defining polynomial for the
 cubic field
 $$\Q(u) = \Q[x]/(x^3 - x - 1) = \Q[x]/(x^3 - 5x^2 + 4x - 1) = \Q(v),$$
 and that $u \to v^2 - 4v + 1$ gives an explicit isomorphism. From this, it is
 easy to convert elements between the $A(u)\in \Q(u)$ and $B(v)\in \Q(v)$
 representations:
 \bprog
 ? A = u^2 + 2*u + 3; subst(lift(A), 'x, w)

 %4 = Mod(26*x^2 + 31*x + 26, x^3 - x - 1)

 If the minimal polynomial of $z$ has lower degree than expected, the routine
 fails

Function: nfbasis
Class: basic

C-Name: nfbasis0
Prototype: GD0,L,DG
Help: nfbasis(x,{flag=0},{fa}): integral basis of the field Q[a], where a is
 a root of the polynomial x, using the round 4 algorithm. Second and third
 args are optional. Binary digits of flag mean 1: assume that no square of a
 prime>primelimit divides the discriminant of x, 2: use round 2 algorithm
 instead. If present, fa provides the matrix of a partial factorization of the
 discriminant of x, useful if one wants only an order maximal at certain
 primes only.
Doc: \idx{integral basis} of the number
 field defined by the irreducible, preferably monic, polynomial $x$, using a
 modified version of the \idx{round 4} algorithm by default, due to David
 \idx{Ford}, Sebastian \idx{Pauli} and Xavier \idx{Roblot}. The binary digits
 of $\fl$ have the following meaning:
 
 1: assume that no square of a prime greater than the default \kbd{primelimit}
 divides the discriminant of $x$, i.e.~that the index of $x$ has only small
 prime divisors.
 
 2: use \idx{round 2} algorithm. For small degrees and coefficient size, this
 is sometimes a little faster. (This program is the translation into C of a
 program written by David \idx{Ford} in Algeb.)
 
 Thus for instance, if $\fl=3$, this uses the round 2 algorithm and outputs
 an order which will be maximal at all the small primes.
 
 If \var{fa} is present, we assume (without checking!) that it is the two-column
 matrix of the factorization of the discriminant of the polynomial $x$. Note
 that it does \emph{not} have to be a complete factorization. This is
 especially useful if only a local integral basis for some small set of places
 is desired: only factors with exponents greater or equal to 2 will be
 considered.
Variant: An extended version is
 \fun{GEN}{nfbasis}{GEN x, GEN *d, long flag, GEN fa = NULL}, where \kbd{*d}
 receives the discriminant of the number field
 (\emph{not} of the polynomial $x$).

Doc: \idx{field discriminant} of the number field defined by the integral,
 preferably monic, irreducible polynomial $x$. $\fl$ and $fa$ are exactly as
 in \kbd{nfbasis}. That is, $fa$ provides the matrix of a partial
 factorization of the discriminant of $x$, and binary digits of $\fl$ are as
 follows:
 
 1: assume that no square of a prime greater than \kbd{primelimit}
 divides the discriminant.
 
 2: use the round 2 algorithm, instead of the default \idx{round 4}. This
 should be slower except maybe for polynomials of small degree and

Doc: factorization of the univariate
 polynomial $x$ over the number field $\var{nf}$ given by \kbd{nfinit}. $x$
 has coefficients in $\var{nf}$ (i.e.~either scalar, polmod, polynomial or
 column vector). The main variable of $\var{nf}$ must be of \emph{lower}
 priority than that of $x$ (see \secref{se:priority}). However if
 the polynomial defining the number field occurs explicitly  in the
 coefficients of $x$ (as modulus of a \typ{POLMOD}), its main variable must be
 \emph{the same} as the main variable of $x$. For example,
 \bprog
 ? nf = nfinit(y^2 + 1);

 ? nffactor(nf, x^2 + Mod(y, y^2+1)); \\ @com OK

 @eprog\noindent It is possible to input a defining polynomial for \var{nf}
 instead, but this is in general less efficient since parts of an \kbd{nf}
 structure will be computed internally. This is useful in two situations: when
 you don't need the \kbd{nf}, or when you can't compute its discriminant due
 to integer factorization difficulties. In the latter case, \tet{addprimes} is
 a possibility but a dangerous one: factors will probably be missed if the
 (true) field discriminant and an \kbd{addprimes} entry are strictly divisible
 by some prime. If you have such an unsafe \var{nf}, it is safer to input
 \kbd{nf.pol}.

 If $e$ is present, $e$ and $f$ must be vectors of the same length ($e$ being

 If not, and $f$ is vector, it is understood as in the preceding case with $e$
 a vector of 1s: we return the product of the $f[i]$. Finally, $f$ can be a
 regular factorization matrix.

 univariate polynomial $x$ modulo the prime ideal \var{pr} in the number
 field $\var{nf}$. $x$ can have coefficients in the number field (scalar,
 polmod, polynomial, column vector) or modulo the prime ideal (intmod
 modulo the rational prime under \var{pr}, polmod or polynomial with
 intmod coefficients, column vector of intmod). The prime ideal
 \var{pr} \emph{must} be in the format output by \kbd{idealprimedec}. The
 main variable of $\var{nf}$ must be of lower priority than that of $x$
 (see \secref{se:priority}). However if the coefficients of the number
 field occur explicitly (as polmods) as coefficients of $x$, the variable of
 these polmods \emph{must} be the same as the main variable of $t$ (see
 \kbd{nffactor}).

Doc: let $\var{nf}$ be a
 number field as output by \kbd{nfinit}, and let \var{aut} be a \idx{Galois}
 automorphism of $\var{nf}$ expressed by its image on the field generator
 (such automorphisms can be found using \kbd{nfgaloisconj}). The function
 computes the action of the automorphism \var{aut} on the object $x$ in the
 number field; $x$ can be a number field element, or an ideal (possibly
 extended). Because of possible confusion with elements and ideals, other
 vector or matrix arguments are forbidden.

 @eprog\noindent The surprising failure of the equality test (\kbd{\%7}) is
 due to the fact that although the corresponding prime ideals are equal, their
 representations are not. (A prime ideal is specificed by a uniformizer, and
 there is no guarantee that applying automorphisms yields the same elements
 as a direct \kbd{idealprimedec} call.)
 
 The automorphism can also be given as a column vector, representing the
 image of \kbd{Mod(x, nf.pol)} as an algebraic number. This last
 representation is more efficient and should be preferred if a given
 automorphism must be used in many such calls.

C-Name: galoisconj0
Prototype: GD0,L,DGp
Help: nfgaloisconj(nf,{flag=0},{d}): list of conjugates of a root of the
 polynomial x=nf.pol in the same number field. flag is optional (set to 0 by
 default), meaning 0: use combination of flag 4 and 1, always complete; 1:
 use nfroots; 2 : use complex numbers, LLL on integral basis (not always
 complete); 4: use Allombert's algorithm, complete if the field is Galois of
 degree <= 35 (see manual for details). nf can be simply a polynomial.
Doc: $\var{nf}$ being a number field as output by \kbd{nfinit}, computes the
 conjugates of a root $r$ of the non-constant polynomial $x=\var{nf}[1]$
 expressed as polynomials in $r$. This also makes sense when the number field
 is not \idx{Galois} since some conjugates may lie in the field.
 $\var{nf}$ can simply be a polynomial.
 
 If no flags or $\fl=0$, use a combination of flag $4$ and $1$ and the result
 is always complete. There is no point whatsoever in using the other flags.
 
 If $\fl=1$, use \kbd{nfroots}: a little slow, but guaranteed to work in
 polynomial time.
 
 If $\fl=2$ (OBSOLETE), use complex approximations to the roots and an integral
 \idx{LLL}. The result is not guaranteed to be complete: some
 conjugates may be missing (a warning is issued if the result is not proved
 complete), especially so if the corresponding polynomial has a huge index,
 and increasing the default precision may help. This variant is slow and
 unreliable: don't use it.
 
 If $\fl=4$, use \kbd{galoisinit}: very fast, but only applies to (most) Galois
 fields. If the field is Galois with weakly
 super-solvable Galois group (see \tet{galoisinit}), return the complete list
 of automorphisms, else only the identity element. If present, $d$ is assumed to
 be a multiple of the least common denominator of the conjugates expressed as
 polynomial in a root of \var{pol}.
 
 This routine can only compute $\Q$-automorphisms, but it may be used to get
 $K$-automorphism for any base field $K$ as follows:
 \bprog
 rnfgaloisconj(nfK, R) = \\ K-automorphisms of L = K[X] / (R)
 { my(polabs, N);
   R *= Mod(1, nfK.pol);             \\ convert coeffs to polmod elts of K
   polabs = rnfequation(nfK, R);
   N = nfgaloisconj(polabs) % R;     \\ Q-automorphisms of L
   \\ select the ones that fix K
   select(s->subst(R, variable(R), Mod(s,R)) == 0, N);
 }
 K  = nfinit(y^2 + 7);
 rnfgaloisconj(K, x^4 - y*x^3 - 3*x^2 + y*x + 1)  \\ K-automorphisms of L

Doc: \var{pol} being a non-constant,
 preferably monic, irreducible polynomial in $\Z[X]$, initializes a
 \emph{number field} structure (\kbd{nf}) associated to the field $K$ defined
 by \var{pol}. As such, it's a technical object passed as the first argument
 to most \kbd{nf}\var{xxx} functions, but it contains some information which
 may be directly useful. Access to this information via \emph{member
 functions} is preferred since the specific data organization specified below
 may change in the future. Currently, \kbd{nf} is a row vector with 9
 components:
 
 $\var{nf}[1]$ contains the polynomial \var{pol} (\kbd{\var{nf}.pol}).
 
 $\var{nf}[2]$ contains $[r1,r2]$ (\kbd{\var{nf}.sign}, \kbd{\var{nf}.r1},
 \kbd{\var{nf}.r2}), the number of real and complex places of $K$.
 
 $\var{nf}[3]$ contains the discriminant $d(K)$ (\kbd{\var{nf}.disc}) of $K$.
 
 $\var{nf}[4]$ contains the index of $\var{nf}[1]$ (\kbd{\var{nf}.index}),
 i.e.~$[\Z_K : \Z[\theta]]$, where $\theta$ is any root of $\var{nf}[1]$.
 
 $\var{nf}[5]$ is a vector containing 7 matrices $M$, $G$, \var{roundG}, $T$,
 $MD$, $TI$, $MDI$ useful for certain computations in the number field $K$.
 
 \quad\item $M$ is the $(r1+r2)\times n$ matrix whose columns represent
 the numerical values of the conjugates of the elements of the integral
 basis.
 
 \quad\item $G$ is an $n\times n$ matrix such that $T2 = {}^t G G$,
 where $T2$ is the quadratic form $T_2(x) = \sum |\sigma(x)|^2$, $\sigma$
 running over the embeddings of $K$ into $\C$.
 
 \quad\item \var{roundG} is a rescaled copy of $G$, rounded to nearest
 integers.
 
 \quad\item $T$ is the $n\times n$ matrix whose coefficients are
 $\text{Tr}(\omega_i\omega_j)$ where the $\omega_i$ are the elements of the
 integral basis. Note also that $\det(T)$ is equal to the discriminant of the
 field $K$. Also, when understood as an ideal, the matrix $T^{-1}$
 generates the codifferent ideal.
 
 \quad\item The columns of $MD$ (\kbd{\var{nf}.diff}) express a $\Z$-basis
 of the different of $K$ on the integral basis.
 
 \quad\item $TI$ is equal to the primitive part of $T^{-1}$, which has integral
 coefficients.
 
 \quad\item Finally, $MDI$ is a two-element representation (for faster
 ideal product) of $d(K)$ times the codifferent ideal
 (\kbd{\var{nf}.disc$*$\var{nf}.codiff}, which is an integral ideal). $MDI$
 is only used in \tet{idealinv}.
 
 $\var{nf}[6]$ is the vector containing the $r1+r2$ roots
 (\kbd{\var{nf}.roots}) of $\var{nf}[1]$ corresponding to the $r1+r2$
 embeddings of the number field into $\C$ (the first $r1$ components are real,
 the next $r2$ have positive imaginary part).
 
 $\var{nf}[7]$ is an integral basis for $\Z_K$ (\kbd{\var{nf}.zk}) expressed
 on the powers of~$\theta$. Its first element is guaranteed to be $1$. This
 basis is LLL-reduced with respect to $T_2$ (strictly speaking, it is a
 permutation of such a basis, due to the condition that the first element be
 $1$).
 
 $\var{nf}[8]$ is the $n\times n$ integral matrix expressing the power
 basis in terms of the integral basis, and finally
 
 $\var{nf}[9]$ is the $n\times n^2$ matrix giving the multiplication table
 of the integral basis.
 
 If a non monic polynomial is input, \kbd{nfinit} will transform it into a
 monic one, then reduce it (see $\fl=3$). It is allowed, though not very
 useful given the existence of \tet{nfnewprec}, to input a \kbd{nf} or a
 \kbd{bnf} instead of a polynomial.

 In case \var{pol} has a huge discriminant which is difficult to factor,
 the special input format $[\var{pol},B]$ is also accepted where \var{pol} is a
 polynomial as above and $B$ is the integer basis, as would be computed by
 \tet{nfbasis}. This is useful if the integer basis is known in advance,
 or was computed conditionally.
 \bprog
 ? pol = polcompositum(x^5 - 101, polcyclo(7))[1];

 @eprog
 \kbd{B} is conditional when its discriminant, which is \kbd{nf.disc}, can't be
 factored. In this example, the above factorization proves the correctness of
 the computation.
 \medskip
 
 If $\fl=2$: \var{pol} is changed into another polynomial $P$ defining the same
 number field, which is as simple as can easily be found using the \kbd{polred}
 algorithm, and all the subsequent computations are done using this new
 polynomial. In particular, the first component of the result is the modified
 polynomial.
 
 If $\fl=3$, does a \kbd{polred} as in case 2, but outputs
 $[\var{nf},\kbd{Mod}(a,P)]$, where $\var{nf}$ is as before and
 $\kbd{Mod}(a,P)=\kbd{Mod}(x,\var{pol})$ gives the change of
 variables. This is implicit when \var{pol} is not monic: first a linear change
 of variables is performed, to get a monic polynomial, then a \kbd{polred}
 reduction.
Variant: Also available are
 \fun{GEN}{nfinit}{GEN x, long prec} ($\fl = 0$),
 \fun{GEN}{nfinitred}{GEN x, long prec} ($\fl = 2$),
 \fun{GEN}{nfinitred2}{GEN x, long prec} ($\fl = 3$).
 Instead of the above hardcoded numerical flags in \kbd{nfinit0}, one should
 rather use
 
 \fun{GEN}{nfinitall}{GEN x, long flag, long prec}, where \fl\ is an
 or-ed combination of
 
 \item \tet{nf_RED}: find a simpler defining polynomial,
 
 \item \tet{nf_ORIG}: if \tet{nf_RED} set, also return the change of variable,
 
 \item \tet{nf_ROUND2}: slow down the routine by using an obsolete
 normalization algorithm (do not use this one!),
 
 \item \tet{nf_PARTIALFACT}: lazy factorization of the polynomial discriminant.
 Result is conditional unless the \emph{field} discriminant obtained
 is fully factored by
 \bprog
   Z_factor_limit(disc, 0)
 @eprog\noindent Namely the ``maximal order'' may not be maximal at any prime
 bigger than \kbd{primelimit} dividing the field discriminant.

 If $y$ is a number field (\var{nf}), a much faster algorithm is used

 coefficients of the number field occur explicitly (as polmods) as
 coefficients of $x$, the variable of these polmods \emph{must} be the same as
 the main variable of $t$ (see \kbd{nffactor}).
 
 It is possible to input a defining polynomial for \var{nf}
 instead, but this is in general less efficient since parts of an \kbd{nf}
 structure will be computed internally. This is useful in two situations: when
 you don't need the \kbd{nf}, or when you can't compute its discriminant due
 to integer factorization difficulties. In the latter case, \tet{addprimes} is
 a possibility but a dangerous one: roots will probably be missed if the
 (true) field discriminant and an \kbd{addprimes} entry are strictly divisible
 by some prime. If you have such an unsafe \var{nf}, it is safer to input
 \kbd{nf.pol}.

 @eprog
 This function guesses the number $w$ as the gcd of the $\#k(v)^*$ for
 unramified $v$ above odd primes, then computes the roots in \var{nf}
 of the $w$-th cyclotomic polynomial: the algorithm is polynomial time with
 respect to the field degree and the bitsize of the multiplication table in
 \var{nf} (both of them polynomially bounded in terms of the size of the
 discriminant). Fields of degree up to $100$ or so should require less than
 one minute.
Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{rootsof1_kannan}{GEN nf}, that computes
 all algebraic integers of $T_2$ norm equal to the field degree
 (all roots of $1$, by Kronecker's theorem). This is in general a little
 faster than the default when there \emph{are} roots of $1$ in the field
 (say twice faster), but can be much slower (say, \emph{days} slower), since
 the algorithm is a priori exponential in the field degree.

 The integrality condition is $a_{i,j} \in b_i a_j^{-1}$ for all $i,j$. If it

Function: norm
Class: basic
Section: conversions
C-Name: gnorm
Prototype: G
Help: norm(x): norm of x.
Doc: 
 algebraic norm of $x$, i.e.~the product of $x$ with
 its conjugate (no square roots are taken), or conjugates for polmods. For
 vectors and matrices, the norm is taken componentwise and hence is not the
 $L^2$-norm (see \kbd{norml2}). Note that the norm of an element of
 $\R$ is its square, so as to be compatible with the complex norm.

Function: norml2
Class: basic
Section: conversions
C-Name: gnorml2
Prototype: G
Help: norml2(x): square of the L2-norm of the vector x.
Doc: 
 square of the $L^2$-norm of $x$. More precisely,
 if $x$ is a scalar, $\kbd{norml2}(x)$ is defined to be \kbd{$x$ * conj($x$)}.
 If $x$ is a polynomial, a (row or column) vector or a matrix, \kbd{norml2($x$)} is
 defined recursively as $\sum_i \kbd{norml2}(x_i)$, where $(x_i)$ run through
 the components of $x$. In particular, this yields the usual $\sum |x_i|^2$
 (resp.~$\sum |x_{i,j}|^2$) if $x$ is a polynomial or vector (resp.~matrix) with
 complex components.

Function: numbpart
Class: basic
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: numbpart
Prototype: G
Help: numbpart(n): number of partitions of n.
Doc: gives the number of unrestricted partitions of
 $n$, usually called $p(n)$ in the literature; in other words the number of
 nonnegative integer solutions to $a+2b+3c+\cdots=n$. $n$ must be of type
 integer and $n<10^{15}$ (with trivial values $p(n) = 0$ for $n < 0$ and
 $p(0) = 1$). The algorithm uses the Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher formula.
 To explicitly enumerate them, see \tet{partitions}.

Function: numdiv
Class: basic
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: gnumbdiv
Prototype: G
Help: numdiv(x): number of divisors of x.
Description: 
 (int):int        numbdiv($1)
 (gen):gen        gnumbdiv($1)
Doc: number of divisors of $|x|$. $x$ must be of type integer.
 The function accepts vector/matrices arguments, and is then applied
 componentwise.
Variant: If $x$ is a \typ{INT}, one may use \fun{GEN}{numbdiv}{GEN n} directly.

Function: numerator
Class: basic
Section: conversions
C-Name: numer
Prototype: G
Help: numerator(x): numerator of x.
Doc: 
 numerator of $x$. The meaning of this
 is clear when $x$ is a rational number or function. If $x$ is an integer
 or a polynomial, it is treated as a rational number or function,
 respectively, and the result is $x$ itself. For polynomials, you
 probably want to use
 \bprog
 numerator( content(x) )
 @eprog\noindent
 instead.
 
 In other cases, \kbd{numerator(x)} is defined to be
 \kbd{denominator(x)*x}. This is the case when $x$ is a vector or a
 matrix, but also for \typ{COMPLEX} or \typ{QUAD}. In particular since a
 \typ{PADIC} or \typ{INTMOD} has  denominator $1$, its numerator is
 itself.
 
 \misctitle{Warning} Multivariate objects are created according to variable
 priorities, with possibly surprising side effects ($x/y$ is a polynomial, but
 $y/x$ is a rational function). See \secref{se:priority}.

Function: numtoperm
Class: basic
Section: conversions
C-Name: numtoperm
Prototype: LG
Help: numtoperm(n,k): permutation number k (mod n!) of n letters (n
 C-integer).
Doc: generates the $k$-th permutation (as a row vector of length $n$) of the
 numbers $1$ to $n$. The number $k$ is taken modulo $n!\,$, i.e.~inverse
 function of \tet{permtonum}.

Function: omega
Class: basic

C-Name: gomega
Prototype: G
Help: omega(x): number of distinct prime divisors of x.
Description:

Doc: number of distinct prime divisors of $|x|$. $x$ must be of type integer.
 \bprog

 ? omega(392)
 %2 = 2;  \\ without multiplicity
 ? bigomega(392)

 @eprog
 The function accepts vector/matrices arguments, and is then applied
 componentwise.
Variant: For a \typ{INT} $x$, the variant
 \fun{long}{omega}{GEN n} is generally easier to use.

Function: padicappr
Class: basic
Section: polynomials
C-Name: padicappr
Prototype: GG
Help: padicappr(pol,a): p-adic roots of the polynomial pol congruent to a mod p.
Doc: vector of $p$-adic roots of the
 polynomial $pol$ congruent to the $p$-adic number $a$ modulo $p$, and with
 the same $p$-adic precision as $a$. The number $a$ can be an ordinary
 $p$-adic number (type \typ{PADIC}, i.e.~an element of $\Z_p$) or can be an
 integral element of a finite extension of $\Q_p$, given as a \typ{POLMOD}
 at least one of whose coefficients is a \typ{PADIC}. In this case, the result
 is the vector of roots belonging to the same extension of $\Q_p$ as $a$.

Function: padicfields
Class: basic
Section: polynomials
C-Name: padicfields0
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: padicfields(p, N, {flag=0}): returns polynomials generating all
 the extensions of degree N of the field of p-adic rational numbers; N is
 allowed to be a 2-component vector [n,d], in which case, returns the
 extensions of degree n and discriminant p^d. flag is optional,
 and can be 0: default, 1: return also the ramification index, the residual
 degree, the valuation of the discriminant and the number of conjugate fields,
 or 2: return only the number of extensions in a fixed algebraic closure.
Doc: returns a vector of polynomials generating all the extensions of degree
 $N$ of the field $\Q_p$ of $p$-adic rational numbers; $N$ is
 allowed to be a 2-component vector $[n,d]$, in which case we return the
 extensions of degree $n$ and discriminant $p^d$.
 
 The list is minimal in the sense that two different polynomials generate
 non-isomorphic extensions; in particular, the number of polynomials is the
 number of classes of isomorphic extensions. If $P$ is a polynomial in this
 list, $\alpha$ is any root of $P$ and $K = \Q_p(\alpha)$, then $\alpha$
 is the sum of a uniformizer and a (lift of a) generator of the residue field
 of $K$; in particular, the powers of $\alpha$ generate the ring of $p$-adic
 integers of $K$.
 
 If $\fl = 1$, replace each polynomial $P$ by a vector $[P, e, f, d, c]$
 where $e$ is the ramification index, $f$ the residual degree, $d$ the
 valuation of the discriminant, and $c$ the number of conjugate fields.
 If $\fl = 2$, only return the \emph{number} of extensions in a fixed
 algebraic closure (Krasner's formula), which is much faster.
Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{padicfields}{GEN p, long n,
 long d, long flag}, which computes extensions of $\Q_p$ of degree $n$ and
 discriminant $p^d$.

Function: padicprec

C-Name: padicprec
Prototype: lGG
Help: padicprec(x,p): absolute p-adic precision of object x.
Doc: absolute $p$-adic precision of the object $x$. This is the minimum
 precision of the components of $x$. The result is \tet{LONG_MAX}
 ($2^{31}-1$ for 32-bit machines or $2^{63}-1$ for 64-bit machines) if $x$ is
 an exact object.

Function: partitions

C-Name: partitions
Prototype: LD0,L,
Help: partitions(n,{restr=0}): return vector of partitions of n, a positive
 integer. The second optional argument may be set to a number smaller than n
 to restrict the value of each element in the partitions to that value. The
 default of 0 means that this maximum is n itself.
Doc: returns vector of partitions of the integer $n$ (negative values return
 \kbd{[]}, $n = 0$ returns the trivial partition of the empty set).
 The second optional argument may be set to a non-negative number smaller than
 $n$ to restrict the value of each element in the partitions to that value.
 The default of 0 means that this maximum is $n$ itself.
 
 A partition is given by a \typ{VECSMALL}:
 \bprog
 ? partitions(4, 2)
 %1 = [Vecsmall([2, 2]), Vecsmall([1, 1, 2]), Vecsmall([1, 1, 1, 1])]
 @eprog\noindent
 correspond to $2+2$, $1+1+2$, $1+1+1+1$.

Function: permtonum
Class: basic

C-Name: permtonum
Prototype: G
Help: permtonum(x): ordinal (between 1 and n!) of permutation x.

 given, the minima (resp. the maxima) of the expression is used instead.
Doc: crude ASCII plot of the function represented by expression \var{expr}
 from $a$ to $b$, with \var{Y} ranging from \var{Ymin} to \var{Ymax}. If
 \var{Ymin} (resp. \var{Ymax}) is not given, the minima (resp. the maxima) of
 the computed values of the expression is used instead.

Help: plotbox(w,x2,y2): if the cursor is at position (x1,y1), draw a box
 with diagonal (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) in rectwindow w (cursor does not move).
Doc: let $(x1,y1)$ be the current position of the virtual cursor. Draw in the
 rectwindow $w$ the outline of the rectangle which is such that the points
 $(x1,y1)$ and $(x2,y2)$ are opposite corners. Only the part of the rectangle
 which is in $w$ is drawn. The virtual cursor does \emph{not} move.

Function: plotclip
Class: highlevel
Section: graphic
C-Name: rectclip
Prototype: vL
Help: plotclip(w): clip the contents of the rectwindow to the bounding box
 (except strings).
Doc: `clips' the content of rectwindow $w$, i.e remove all parts of the
 drawing that would not be visible on the screen. Together with
 \tet{plotcopy} this function enables you to draw on a scratchpad before
 committing the part you're interested in to the final picture.

Function: plotcolor

C-Name: rectcolor
Prototype: vLL
Help: plotcolor(w,c): in rectwindow w, set default color to c. Possible
 values for c are given by the graphcolormap default: factory settings
 are 1=black, 2=blue, 3=sienna, 4=red, 5=green, 6=grey, 7=gainsborough.
Doc: set default color to $c$ in rectwindow $w$.
 This is only implemented for the X-windows, fltk and Qt graphing engines.
 Possible values for $c$ are given by the \tet{graphcolormap} default,
 factory setting are
 
 1=black, 2=blue, 3=violetred, 4=red, 5=green, 6=grey, 7=gainsborough.

Doc: copy the contents of rectwindow \var{sourcew} to rectwindow \var{destw}

Help: plotdraw(list, {flag=0}): draw vector of rectwindows list at indicated
 x,y positions; list is a vector w1,x1,y1,w2,x2,y2,etc. If flag!=0, x1, y1
 etc. express fractions of the size of the current output device.
Doc: physically draw the rectwindows given in $list$
 which must be a vector whose number of components is divisible by 3. If
 $list=[w1,x1,y1,w2,x2,y2,\dots]$, the windows $w1$, $w2$, etc.~are
 physically placed with their upper left corner at physical position
 $(x1,y1)$, $(x2,y2)$,\dots\ respectively, and are then drawn together.
 Overlapping regions will thus be drawn twice, and the windows are considered
 transparent. Then display the whole drawing in a special window on your
 screen. If $\fl \neq 0$, x1, y1 etc. express fractions of the size of the
 current output device

Function: ploth
Class: highlevel
Section: graphic
C-Name: ploth
Prototype: V=GGEpD0,M,D0,L,\nParametric|1; Recursive|2; no_Rescale|4; no_X_axis|8; no_Y_axis|16; no_Frame|32; no_Lines|64; Points_too|128; Splines|256; no_X_ticks|512; no_Y_ticks|1024; Same_ticks|2048; Complex|4096
Help: ploth(X=a,b,expr,{flags=0},{n=0}): plot of expression expr, X goes
 from a to b in high resolution. Both flags and n are optional. Binary digits
 of flags mean: 1=Parametric, 2=Recursive, 4=no_Rescale, 8=no_X_axis,
 16=no_Y_axis, 32=no_Frame, 64=no_Lines (do not join points), 128=Points_too
 (plot both lines and points), 256=Splines (use cubic splines),
 512=no_X_ticks, 1024= no_Y_ticks, 2048=Same_ticks (plot all ticks with the
 same length), 4096=Complex (the two coordinates of each points are encoded
 as a complex number). n specifies number of reference points on the graph
 (0=use default value). Returns a vector for the bounding box.
Doc: high precision plot of the function $y=f(x)$ represented by the expression
 \var{expr}, $x$ going from $a$ to $b$. This opens a specific window (which is
 killed whenever you click on it), and returns a four-component vector giving
 the coordinates of the bounding box in the form
 $[\var{xmin},\var{xmax},\var{ymin},\var{ymax}]$.
 
 \misctitle{Important note}: \kbd{ploth} may evaluate \kbd{expr} thousands of
 times; given the relatively low resolution of plotting devices, few
 significant digits of the result will be meaningful. Hence you should keep
 the current precision to a minimum (e.g.~9) before calling this function.
 
 $n$ specifies the number of reference point on the graph, where a value of 0
 means we use the hardwired default values (1000 for general plot, 1500 for
 parametric plot, and 15 for recursive plot).
 
 If no $\fl$ is given, \var{expr} is either a scalar expression $f(X)$, in which
 case the plane curve $y=f(X)$ will be drawn, or a vector
 $[f_1(X),\dots,f_k(X)]$, and then all the curves $y=f_i(X)$ will be drawn in
 the same window.
 
 \noindent The binary digits of $\fl$ mean:
 
 \item $1 = \kbd{Parametric}$: \tev{parametric plot}. Here \var{expr} must
 be a vector with an even number of components. Successive pairs are then
 understood as the parametric coordinates of a plane curve. Each of these are
 then drawn.
 
 For instance:
 \bprog
 ploth(X=0,2*Pi,[sin(X),cos(X)], "Parametric")
 ploth(X=0,2*Pi,[sin(X),cos(X)])
 ploth(X=0,2*Pi,[X,X,sin(X),cos(X)], "Parametric")
 @eprog\noindent draw successively a circle, two entwined sinusoidal curves
 and a circle cut by the line $y=x$.
 
 \item $2 = \kbd{Recursive}$: \tev{recursive plot}. If this flag is set,
 only \emph{one} curve can be drawn at a time, i.e.~\var{expr} must be either a
 two-component vector (for a single parametric curve, and the parametric flag
 \emph{has} to be set), or a scalar function. The idea is to choose pairs of
 successive reference points, and if their middle point is not too far away
 from the segment joining them, draw this as a local approximation to the
 curve. Otherwise, add the middle point to the reference points. This is
 fast, and usually more precise than usual plot. Compare the results of
 \bprog
 ploth(X=-1,1, sin(1/X), "Recursive")
 ploth(X=-1,1, sin(1/X))
 @eprog\noindent
 for instance. But beware that if you are extremely unlucky, or choose too few
 reference points, you may draw some nice polygon bearing little resemblance
 to the original curve. For instance you should \emph{never} plot recursively
 an odd function in a symmetric interval around 0. Try
 \bprog
 ploth(x = -20, 20, sin(x), "Recursive")
 @eprog\noindent
 to see why. Hence, it's usually a good idea to try and plot the same curve
 with slightly different parameters.
 
 The other values toggle various display options:
 
 \item $4 = \kbd{no\_Rescale}$: do not rescale plot according to the
 computed extrema. This is used in conjunction with \tet{plotscale} when
 graphing multiple functions on a rectwindow (as a \tet{plotrecth} call):
 \bprog
   s = plothsizes();
   plotinit(0, s[2]-1, s[2]-1);
   plotscale(0, -1,1, -1,1);
   plotrecth(0, t=0,2*Pi, [cos(t),sin(t)], "Parametric|no_Rescale")
   plotdraw([0, -1,1]);
 @eprog\noindent
 This way we get a proper circle instead of the distorted ellipse produced by
 \bprog
   ploth(t=0,2*Pi, [cos(t),sin(t)], "Parametric")
 @eprog
 
 \item $8 = \kbd{no\_X\_axis}$: do not print the $x$-axis.
 
 \item $16 = \kbd{no\_Y\_axis}$: do not print the $y$-axis.
 
 \item $32 = \kbd{no\_Frame}$: do not print frame.
 
 \item $64 = \kbd{no\_Lines}$: only plot reference points, do not join them.
 
 \item $128 = \kbd{Points\_too}$: plot both lines and points.
 
 \item $256 = \kbd{Splines}$: use splines to interpolate the points.
 
 \item $512 = \kbd{no\_X\_ticks}$: plot no $x$-ticks.
 
 \item $1024 = \kbd{no\_Y\_ticks}$: plot no $y$-ticks.
 
 \item $2048 = \kbd{Same\_ticks}$: plot all ticks with the same length.
 
 \item $4096 = \kbd{Complex}$: is a parametric plot but where each member of
 \kbd{expr} is considered a complex number encoding the two coordinates of a
 point. For instance:
 \bprog
 ploth(X=0,2*Pi,exp(I*X), "Complex")
 ploth(X=0,2*Pi,[(1+I)*X,exp(I*X)], "Complex")
 @eprog\noindent will draw respectively a circle and a circle cut by the line
 $y=x$.

 other non-0 flags should be combinations of bits 8,16,32,64,128,256 meaning
 the same as for ploth().
Doc: given \var{listx} and \var{listy} two vectors of equal length, plots (in
 high precision) the points whose $(x,y)$-coordinates are given in
 \var{listx} and \var{listy}. Automatic positioning and scaling is done, but
 with the same scaling factor on $x$ and $y$. If $\fl$ is 1, join points,
 other non-0 flags toggle display options and should be combinations of bits

Doc: return data corresponding to the output window
 in the form of a 6-component vector: window width and height, sizes for ticks

C-Name: initrect_gen
Prototype: vLDGDGD0,L,
Help: plotinit(w,{x},{y},{flag=0}): initialize rectwindow w to size x,y.
 If flag!=0, x and y express fractions of the size of the current output
 device. Omitting x or y means use the full size of the device.
Doc: initialize the rectwindow $w$,
 destroying any rect objects you may have already drawn in $w$. The virtual
 cursor is set to $(0,0)$. The rectwindow size is set to width $x$ and height
 $y$; omitting either $x$ or $y$ means we use the full size of the device
 in that direction.
 If $\fl=0$, $x$ and $y$ represent pixel units. Otherwise, $x$ and $y$
 are understood as fractions of the size of the current output device (hence
 must be between $0$ and $1$) and internally converted to pixels.
 
 The plotting device imposes an upper bound for $x$ and $y$, for instance the
 number of pixels for screen output. These bounds are available through the
 \tet{plothsizes} function. The following sequence initializes in a portable
 way (i.e independent of the output device) a window of maximal size, accessed
 through coordinates in the $[0,1000] \times [0,1000]$ range:
 
 \bprog
 s = plothsizes();
 plotinit(0, s[1]-1, s[2]-1);
 plotscale(0, 0,1000, 0,1000);

C-Name: killrect

Help: plotkill(w): erase the rectwindow w.
Doc: erase rectwindow $w$ and free the corresponding memory. Note that if you
 want to use the rectwindow $w$ again, you have to use \kbd{plotinit} first
 to specify the new size. So it's better in this case to use \kbd{plotinit}
 directly as this throws away any previous work in the given rectwindow.

Function: plotlines
Class: highlevel
Section: graphic
C-Name: rectlines
Prototype: vLGGD0,L,
Help: plotlines(w,X,Y,{flag=0}): draws an open polygon in rectwindow
 w where X and Y contain the x (resp. y) coordinates of the vertices.
 If X and Y are both single values (i.e not vectors), draw the
 corresponding line (and move cursor). If (optional) flag is non-zero, close
 the polygon.
Doc: draw on the rectwindow $w$
 the polygon such that the (x,y)-coordinates of the vertices are in the
 vectors of equal length $X$ and $Y$. For simplicity, the whole
 polygon is drawn, not only the part of the polygon which is inside the
 rectwindow. If $\fl$ is non-zero, close the polygon. In any case, the
 virtual cursor does not move.
 
 $X$ and $Y$ are allowed to be scalars (in this case, both have to).
 There, a single segment will be drawn, between the virtual cursor current
 position and the point $(X,Y)$. And only the part thereof which
 actually lies within the boundary of $w$. Then \emph{move} the virtual cursor
 to $(X,Y)$, even if it is outside the window. If you want to draw a
 line from $(x1,y1)$ to $(x2,y2)$ where $(x1,y1)$ is not necessarily the
 position of the virtual cursor, use \kbd{plotmove(w,x1,y1)} before using this
 function.

 \var{type} $-2$ corresponds to frames, $-1$ to axes, larger values may

 cursor).
Doc: draw on the rectwindow $w$ the
 points whose $(x,y)$-coordinates are in the vectors of equal length $X$ and
 $Y$ and which are inside $w$. The virtual cursor does \emph{not} move. This
 is basically the same function as \kbd{plothraw}, but either with no scaling
 factor or with a scale chosen using the function \kbd{plotscale}.
 
 As was the case with the \kbd{plotlines} function, $X$ and $Y$ are allowed to
 be (simultaneously) scalar. In this case, draw the single point $(X,Y)$ on
 the rectwindow $w$ (if it is actually inside $w$), and in any case
 \emph{move} the virtual cursor to position $(x,y)$.

C-Name: rectplothraw
Prototype: LGD0,L,
Help: plotrecthraw(w,data,{flags=0}): plot graph(s) for data in rectwindow
 w, where data is a vector of vectors. If plot is parametric, length of data
 should be even, and pairs of entries give curves to plot. If not, first
 entry gives x-coordinate, and the other ones y-coordinates. Admits the same
 optional flags as plotrecth, save that recursive plot is meaningless.
Doc: plot graph(s) for
 \var{data} in rectwindow $w$. $\fl$ has the same significance here as in
 \kbd{ploth}, though recursive plot is no more significant.
 
 \var{data} is a vector of vectors, each corresponding to a list a coordinates.
 If parametric plot is set, there must be an even number of vectors, each
 successive pair corresponding to a curve. Otherwise, the first one contains
 the $x$ coordinates, and the other ones contain the $y$-coordinates
 of curves to plot.

Doc: scale the local coordinates of the rectwindow $w$ so that $x$ goes from
 $x1$ to $x2$ and $y$ goes from $y1$ to $y2$ ($x2<x1$ and $y2<y1$ being
 allowed). Initially, after the initialization of the rectwindow $w$ using
 the function \kbd{plotinit}, the default scaling is the graphic pixel count,
 and in particular the $y$ axis is oriented downwards since the origin is at
 the upper left. The function \kbd{plotscale} allows to change all these
 defaults and should be used whenever functions are graphed.

Function: plotstring

C-Name: rectstring3
Prototype: vLsD0,L,
Help: plotstring(w,x,{flags=0}): draw in rectwindow w the string

 if 0, right if 2, center if 1. Bits 4 and 8 regulate vertical alignment:
 bottom if 0, top if 8, v-center if 4. Can insert additional gap between
 point and string: horizontal if bit 16 is set, vertical if bit 32 is set.
Doc: draw on the rectwindow $w$ the String $x$ (see \secref{se:strings}), at
 the current position of the cursor.
 
 \fl\ is used for justification: bits 1 and 2 regulate horizontal alignment:
 left if 0, right if 2, center if 1. Bits 4 and 8 regulate vertical
 alignment: bottom if 0, top if 8, v-center if 4. Can insert additional small
 gap between point and string: horizontal if bit 16 is set, vertical if bit
 32 is set (see the tutorial for an example).

Function: polchebyshev

C-Name: polchebyshev_eval
Prototype: LD1,L,DG
Help: polchebyshev(n,{flag=1},{a='x}): Chebychev polynomial of the first (flag

Description: 
 (small,?1,?var):gen polchebyshev1($1,$3)
 (small,2,?var):gen  polchebyshev2($1,$3)
 (small,small,?var):gen polchebyshev($1,$2,$3)
Doc: returns the $n^{\text{th}}$
 \idx{Chebyshev} polynomial of the first kind $T_n$ ($\fl=1$) or the second
 kind $U_n$ ($\fl=2$), evaluated at $a$ (\kbd{'x} by default). Both series of
 polynomials satisfy the 3-term relation
 $$ P_{n+1} = 2xP_n - P_{n-1}, $$
 and are determined by the initial conditions $U_0 = T_0 = 1$, $T_1 = x$,
 $U_1 = 2x$. In fact $T_n' = n U_{n-1}$ and, for all complex numbers $z$, we
 have $T_n(\cos z) = \cos (nz)$ and $U_{n-1}(\cos z) = \sin(nz)/\sin z$.
 If $n \geq 0$, then these polynomials have degree $n$.  For $n < 0$,
 $T_n$ is equal to $T_{-n}$ and $U_n$ is equal to $-U_{-2-n}$.
 In particular, $U_{-1} = 0$.
Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{polchebyshev1}{long n, long v} and
 \fun{GEN}{polchebyshev2}{long n, long v} for $T_n$ and $U_n$ respectively.

Function: polcoeff
Class: basic
Section: polynomials
C-Name: polcoeff0
Prototype: GLDn
Help: polcoeff(x,n,{v}): coefficient of degree n of x, or the n-th component
 for vectors or matrices (for which it is simpler to use x[]). With respect
 to the main variable if v is omitted, with respect to the variable v
 otherwise.
Description: 
 (pol, 0):gen:copy      constant_term($1)
 (gen, small, ?var):gen polcoeff0($1, $2, $3)
Doc: coefficient of degree $n$ of the polynomial $x$, with respect to the
 main variable if $v$ is omitted, with respect to $v$ otherwise.  If $n$
 is greater than the degree, the result is zero.
 
 Naturally applies to scalars (polynomial of degree $0$), as well as to
 rational functions whose denominator is a monomial.
 It also applies to power series: if $n$ is less than the valuation, the result
 is zero. If it is greater than the largest significant degree, then an error
 message is issued.
 
  For greater flexibility, vector or matrix types are also accepted for $x$,
  and the meaning is then identical with that of \kbd{component(x,n)}.

Function: polcompositum
Class: basic
Section: number_fields
C-Name: polcompositum0
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: polcompositum(P,Q,{flag=0}): vector of all possible compositums
 of the number fields defined by the polynomials P and Q. If (optional)
 flag is set (i.e non-null), output for each compositum, not only the
 compositum polynomial pol, but a vector [R,a,b,k] where a (resp. b) is a root
 of P (resp. Q) expressed as a polynomial modulo R,
 and a small integer k such that al2+k*al1 is the chosen root of R.
Doc: \sidx{compositum} $P$ and $Q$
 being squarefree polynomials in $\Z[X]$ in the same variable, outputs
 the simple factors of the \'etale $\Q$-algebra $A = \Q(X, Y) / (P(X), Q(Y))$.
 The factors are given by a list of polynomials $R$ in $\Z[X]$, associated to
 the number field $\Q(X)/ (R)$, and sorted by increasing degree (with respect
 to lexicographic ordering for factors of equal degrees). Returns an error if
 one of the polynomials is not squarefree.
 
 Note that it is more efficient to reduce to the case where $P$ and $Q$ are
 irreducible first. The routine will not perform this for you, since it may be
 expensive, and the inputs are irreducible in most applications anyway.
 Assuming $P$ is irreducible (of smaller degree than $Q$ for efficiency), it
 is in general \emph{much} faster to proceed as follows
 \bprog
 nf = nfinit(P); L = nffactor(nf, Q)[,1];
 vector(#L, i, rnfequation(nf, L[i]))
 @eprog\noindent
 to obtain the same result. If you are only interested in the degrees of the
 simple factors, the \kbd{rnfequation} instruction can be replaced by a
 trivial \kbd{poldegree(P) * poldegree(L[i])}.
 
 If $\fl=1$, outputs a vector of 4-component vectors $[R,a,b,k]$, where $R$
 ranges through the list of all possible compositums as above, and $a$
 (resp. $b$) expresses the root of $P$ (resp. $Q$) as an element of
 $\Q(X)/(R)$. Finally, $k$ is a small integer such that $b + ka = X$ modulo
 $R$.
 
 A compositum is quite often defined by a complicated polynomial, which it is
 advisable to reduce before further work. Here is a simple example involving
 the field $\Q(\zeta_5, 5^{1/5})$:
 \bprog
 ? z = polcompositum(x^5 - 5, polcyclo(5), 1)[1];
 ? pol = z[1]                 \\@com \kbd{pol} defines the compositum

 - 320*x + 256
 ? a = z[2]; a^5 - 5          \\@com \kbd{a} is a fifth root of $5$
 %3 = 0
 ? z = polredabs(pol, 1);     \\@com look for a simpler polynomial

 %5 = x^20 + 25*x^10 + 5
 ? a = subst(a.pol, x, z[2])  \\@com \kbd{a} in the new coordinates
 %6 = Mod(-5/22*x^19 + 1/22*x^14 - 123/22*x^9 + 9/11*x^4, x^20 + 25*x^10 + 5)

C-Name: polcyclo_eval

Help: polcyclo(n,{a = 'x}): n-th cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at a.
Description: 
  (small,?var):gen     polcyclo($1,$2)
  (small,gen):gen      polcyclo_eval($1,$2)
Doc: $n$-th cyclotomic polynomial, evaluated at $a$ (\kbd{'x} by default). The
 integer $n$ must be positive.
 
 Algorithm used: reduce to the case where $n$ is squarefree; to compute the
 cyclotomic polynomial, use $\Phi_{np}(x)=\Phi_n(x^p)/\Phi(x)$; to compute
 it evaluated, use $\Phi_n(x) = \prod_{d\mid n} (x^d-1)^{\mu(n/d)}$. In the
 evaluated case, the algorithm can deal with all rational values $a$;
 otherwise it assumes that $a^d - 1$ is invertible for all $d\mid n$. If this
 is not the case, use \kbd{subst(polcyclo(n),x,a)}.
Variant: The variant \fun{GEN}{polcyclo}{long n, long v} returns the $n$-th
 cyclotomic polynomial in variable $v$.

Function: poldegree
Class: basic

C-Name: poldegree

Help: poldegree(x,{v}): degree of the polynomial or rational function x with
 respect to main variable if v is omitted, with respect to v otherwise.
 For scalar x, return 0 is x is non-zero and a negative number otherwise.
Description:

 (gen):small                degree($1)
 (gen, var):small           poldegree($1, $2)
Doc: degree of the polynomial $x$ in the main variable if $v$ is omitted, in
 the variable $v$ otherwise.
 
 The degree of $0$ is a fixed negative number, whose exact value should not
 be used. The degree of a non-zero scalar is $0$. Finally, when $x$ is a
 non-zero polynomial or rational function, returns the ordinary degree of
 $x$. Raise an error otherwise.

Function: polgalois
Class: basic
Section: number_fields
C-Name: polgalois
Prototype: Gp
Help: polgalois(x): Galois group of the polynomial x (see manual for group
 coding). Return [n, s, k, name] where n is the order, s the signature, k the
 index and name is the GAP4 name of the transitive group.
Doc: \idx{Galois} group of the non-constant
 polynomial $x\in\Q[X]$. In the present version \vers, $x$ must be irreducible
 and the degree of $x$ must be less than or equal to 7. On certain versions for
 which the data file of Galois resolvents has been installed (available in the
 Unix distribution as a separate package), degrees 8, 9, 10 and 11 are also
 implemented.
 
 The output is a 4-component vector $[n,s,k,name]$ with the
 following meaning: $n$ is the cardinality of the group, $s$ is its signature
 ($s=1$ if the group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$, $s=-1$
 otherwise) and name is a character string containing name of the transitive
 group according to the GAP 4 transitive groups library by Alexander Hulpke.
 
 $k$ is more arbitrary and the choice made up to version~2.2.3 of PARI is rather
 unfortunate: for $n > 7$, $k$ is the numbering of the group among all
 transitive subgroups of $S_n$, as given in ``The transitive groups of degree up
 to eleven'', G.~Butler and J.~McKay, \emph{Communications in Algebra}, vol.~11,
 1983,
 pp.~863--911 (group $k$ is denoted $T_k$ there). And for $n \leq 7$, it was ad
 hoc, so as to ensure that a given triple would design a unique group.
 Specifically, for polynomials of degree $\leq 7$, the groups are coded as
 follows, using standard notations
 \smallskip
 In degree 1: $S_1=[1,1,1]$.
 \smallskip
 In degree 2: $S_2=[2,-1,1]$.
 \smallskip
 In degree 3: $A_3=C_3=[3,1,1]$, $S_3=[6,-1,1]$.
 \smallskip
 In degree 4: $C_4=[4,-1,1]$, $V_4=[4,1,1]$, $D_4=[8,-1,1]$, $A_4=[12,1,1]$,
 $S_4=[24,-1,1]$.
 \smallskip
 In degree 5: $C_5=[5,1,1]$, $D_5=[10,1,1]$, $M_{20}=[20,-1,1]$,
 $A_5=[60,1,1]$, $S_5=[120,-1,1]$.
 \smallskip
 In degree 6: $C_6=[6,-1,1]$, $S_3=[6,-1,2]$, $D_6=[12,-1,1]$, $A_4=[12,1,1]$,
 $G_{18}=[18,-1,1]$, $S_4^-=[24,-1,1]$, $A_4\times C_2=[24,-1,2]$,
 $S_4^+=[24,1,1]$, $G_{36}^-=[36,-1,1]$, $G_{36}^+=[36,1,1]$,
 $S_4\times C_2=[48,-1,1]$, $A_5=PSL_2(5)=[60,1,1]$, $G_{72}=[72,-1,1]$,
 $S_5=PGL_2(5)=[120,-1,1]$, $A_6=[360,1,1]$, $S_6=[720,-1,1]$.
 \smallskip
 In degree 7: $C_7=[7,1,1]$, $D_7=[14,-1,1]$, $M_{21}=[21,1,1]$,
 $M_{42}=[42,-1,1]$, $PSL_2(7)=PSL_3(2)=[168,1,1]$, $A_7=[2520,1,1]$,
 $S_7=[5040,-1,1]$.
 \smallskip
 This is deprecated and obsolete, but for reasons of backward compatibility,
 we cannot change this behavior yet. So you can use the default
 \tet{new_galois_format} to switch to a consistent naming scheme, namely $k$ is
 always the standard numbering of the group among all transitive subgroups of
 $S_n$. If this default is in effect, the above groups will be coded as:
 \smallskip
 In degree 1: $S_1=[1,1,1]$.
 \smallskip
 In degree 2: $S_2=[2,-1,1]$.
 \smallskip
 In degree 3: $A_3=C_3=[3,1,1]$, $S_3=[6,-1,2]$.
 \smallskip
 In degree 4: $C_4=[4,-1,1]$, $V_4=[4,1,2]$, $D_4=[8,-1,3]$, $A_4=[12,1,4]$,
 $S_4=[24,-1,5]$.
 \smallskip
 In degree 5: $C_5=[5,1,1]$, $D_5=[10,1,2]$, $M_{20}=[20,-1,3]$,
 $A_5=[60,1,4]$, $S_5=[120,-1,5]$.
 \smallskip
 In degree 6: $C_6=[6,-1,1]$, $S_3=[6,-1,2]$, $D_6=[12,-1,3]$, $A_4=[12,1,4]$,
 $G_{18}=[18,-1,5]$, $A_4\times C_2=[24,-1,6]$, $S_4^+=[24,1,7]$,
 $S_4^-=[24,-1,8]$, $G_{36}^-=[36,-1,9]$, $G_{36}^+=[36,1,10]$,
 $S_4\times C_2=[48,-1,11]$, $A_5=PSL_2(5)=[60,1,12]$, $G_{72}=[72,-1,13]$,
 $S_5=PGL_2(5)=[120,-1,14]$, $A_6=[360,1,15]$, $S_6=[720,-1,16]$.
 \smallskip
 In degree 7: $C_7=[7,1,1]$, $D_7=[14,-1,2]$, $M_{21}=[21,1,3]$,
 $M_{42}=[42,-1,4]$, $PSL_2(7)=PSL_3(2)=[168,1,5]$, $A_7=[2520,1,6]$,
 $S_7=[5040,-1,7]$.
 \smallskip
 
 \misctitle{Warning} The method used is that of resolvent polynomials and is
 sensitive to the current precision. The precision is updated internally but,
 in very rare cases, a wrong result may be returned if the initial precision
 was not sufficient.

Function: polred
Class: basic
Section: number_fields
C-Name: polred0
Prototype: GD0,L,DG
Help: polred(x,{flag=0},{fa}): reduction of the polynomial x (gives minimal
 polynomials only). Second and third args are optional. The following binary
 digits of flag are significant 1: partial reduction, 2: gives also elements.
 fa, if present, contains the factorization matrix of the discriminant.
Doc: finds polynomials with reasonably
 small coefficients defining subfields of the number field defined by $x$.
 One of the polynomials always defines $\Q$ (hence is equal to $x-1$),
 and another always defines the same number field as $x$ if $x$ is irreducible.
 All $x$ accepted by \tet{nfinit} are also allowed here (e.g. non-monic
 polynomials, \kbd{nf}, \kbd{bnf}, \kbd{[x,Z\_K\_basis]}).
 
 The following binary digits of $\fl$ are significant:
 
 1: possibly use a suborder of the maximal order. The primes dividing the
 index of the order chosen are larger than \tet{primelimit} or divide integers
 stored in the \tet{addprimes} table.
 
 2: gives also elements. The result is a two-column matrix, the first column
 giving primitive elements defining these subfields, the second giving the
 corresponding minimal polynomials.
 \bprog
 ? M = polred(x^4 + 8, 2)
 %1 =
 [1 x - 1]
 
 [1/2*x^2 x^2 + 2]
 
 [1/4*x^3 x^4 + 2]
 
 [x x^4 + 8]
 ? minpoly(Mod(M[2,1], x^4+8))
 %2 = x^2 + 2
 @eprog\noindent
 If $fa$ is given, it is assumed that it is the two-column matrix of the
 factorization of the discriminant of the polynomial $x$.
Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{polred}{GEN x} ($\fl = 0$). The function
 \kbd{polred0} is provided for backward compatibility; instead of the above
 hardcoded numerical flags (which happen to be inconsistent), one should use
 \fun{GEN}{Polred}{GEN x, long flag, GEN fa} where  flag  is  an or-ed
 combination of \tet{nf_PARTIALFACT} (partial factorization of the
 discriminant) and \tet{nf_ORIG} (give also elements).

Function: polredabs
Class: basic
Section: number_fields
C-Name: polredabs0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: polredabs(T,{flag=0}): a smallest generating polynomial of the number
 field for the T2 norm on the roots, with smallest index for the minimal T2
 norm. flag is optional, whose binary digit mean 1: give the element whose
 characteristic polynomial is the given polynomial. 4: give all polynomials
 of minimal T2 norm (give only one of P(x) and P(-x)). 16: partial reduction.
Doc: returns a canonical defining polynomial $P$ for the same number field
 defined by $T$, such that the sum of the squares of the modulus of the
 roots (i.e.~the $T_2$-norm) is minimal. Different $T$ defining isomorphic
 number fields will yield the same $P$.
 All $T$ accepted by \tet{nfinit} are also allowed here: non-monic
 polynomials, \kbd{nf}, \kbd{bnf}, \kbd{[T, Z\_K\_basis]}.
 
 \misctitle{Warning} This routine uses an exponential-time algorithm to
 enumerate all potential generators, and may be exceedingly slow when the
 number field has many subfields, hence a lot of elements of small $T_2$-norm.
 E.g. do not try it on the compositum of many quadratic fields; in that case,
 use \tet{polred} instead.
 
 The binary digits of $\fl$ mean
 
 1: outputs a two-component row vector $[P,a]$, where $P$ is the default
 output and \kbd{Mod(a, P)} is a root of the original $T$.
 
 4: gives \emph{all} polynomials of minimal $T_2$ norm; of the two polynomials
 $P(x)$ and $\pm P(-x)$, only one is given.
 
 16: possibly use a suborder of the maximal order. The primes dividing the
 index of the order chosen are larger than \tet{primelimit} or divide integers
 stored in the \tet{addprimes} table. In that case the polynomial $P$ is
 no longer canonical, and it may happen that it does not have minimal
 $T_2$ norm. You should always include this flag; without it, the routine
 will often spend infinite time trying to factor the discriminant of $T$. As
 long as the discriminant of the \emph{field} $\Q[X]/(T)$ is easy to factor
 (has at most one large prime factor not in the \kbd{addprimes} table), the
 result is the same.
Variant: Instead of the above hardcoded numerical flags, one should use an
 or-ed combination of
 
 \item \tet{nf_PARTIALFACT}: partial factorization of the discriminant,
 possibly work in a non-maximal order. You should always include this.
 
 \item \tet{nf_ORIG}: return $[P, a]$, where \kbd{Mod(a, P)} is a root of $T$.
 
 \item \tet{nf_RAW}: return $[P, b]$, where \kbd{Mod(b, T)} is a root of $P$.
 The algebraic integer $b$ is the raw result produced by the small vectors
 enumeration in the maximal order; $P$ was computed as the characteristic
 polynomial of \kbd{Mod(b, T)}. \kbd{Mod(a, P)} as in \tet{nf_ORIG}
 is obtained with \tet{modreverse}.
 
 \item \tet{nf_ADDZK}: if $r$ is the result produced with some of the above
 flags (of the form $P$ or $[P,c]$), return \kbd{[r,zk]}, where \kbd{zk} is a
 $\Z$-basis for the maximal order of $\Q[X]/(P)$.
 
 \item \tet{nf_ALL}: return a vector of results of the above form, for all
 polynomials of minimal $T_2$-norm.

Function: polredord
Class: basic
Section: number_fields
C-Name: ordred
Prototype: G
Help: polredord(x): reduction of the polynomial x, staying in the same order.
Doc: finds polynomials with reasonably small
 coefficients and of the same degree as that of $x$ defining suborders of the
 order defined by $x$. One of the polynomials always defines $\Q$ (hence
 is equal to $(x-1)^n$, where $n$ is the degree), and another always defines
 the same order as $x$ if $x$ is irreducible. Useless function: try
 \kbd{polred(,1)} or \kbd{polredabs(,16)}.

Function: polresultant
Class: basic
Section: polynomials
C-Name: polresultant0
Prototype: GGDnD0,L,
Help: polresultant(x,y,{v},{flag=0}): resultant of the polynomials x and y,
 with respect to the main variables of x and y if v is omitted, with respect
 to the variable v otherwise. flag is optional, and can be 0: default,
 uses either the subresultant algorithm, a modular algorithm or Sylvester's
 matrix, depending on the inputs; 1 uses Sylvester's matrix (should always be
 slower than the default).
Doc: resultant of the two
 polynomials $x$ and $y$ with exact entries, with respect to the main
 variables of $x$ and $y$ if $v$ is omitted, with respect to the variable $v$
 otherwise. The algorithm assumes the base ring is a domain. If you also need
 the $u$ and $v$ such that $x*u + y*v = res(x,y)$, use the \tet{bezoutres}
 function.
 
 If $\fl=0$ (default), uses the the algorithm best suited to the inputs,
 either the \idx{subresultant algorithm} (Lazard/Ducos variant, generic case),
 a modular algorithm (inputs in $\Q[X]$) or Sylvester's matrix (inexact
 inputs).
 
 If $\fl=1$, uses the determinant of Sylvester's matrix instead; this should
 always be slower than the default.

Function: polroots
Class: basic
Section: polynomials
C-Name: roots0
Prototype: GD0,L,p
Help: polroots(x,{flag=0}): complex roots of the polynomial x. flag is
 optional, and can be 0: default, uses Schonhage's method modified by
 Gourdon, or 1: uses a modified Newton method.
Doc: complex roots of the polynomial
 \var{pol}, given as a column vector where each root is repeated according to
 its multiplicity. The precision is given as for transcendental functions: in
 GP it is kept in the variable \kbd{realprecision} and is transparent to the
 user, but it must be explicitly given as a second argument in library mode.
 
 The algorithm used is a modification of A.~Sch\"onhage\sidx{Sch\"onage}'s
 root-finding algorithm, due to and implemented by X.~Gourdon. Barring bugs, it
 is guaranteed to converge and to give the roots to the required accuracy.
 
 If $\fl=1$, use a variant of the Newton-Raphson method, which is \emph{not}
 guaranteed to converge, nor to give accurate results, but is rather
 fast when it does. If you get the messages ``too many iterations in roots''
 or ``INTERNAL ERROR: incorrect result in roots'', use the default algorithm.
Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{roots}{GEN x, long prec}, as well as
 \fun{GEN}{cleanroots}{GEN x, long prec} which ensures that real roots of
 real polynomials are returned as \typ{REAL} (instead of \typ{COMPLEX}s with
 0 imaginary part).

Help: polrootsff(x,{p},{a}): returns the roots of the polynomial x in the finite

Doc: returns the vector of distinct roots of the polynomial $x$ in the field
 $\F_q$ defined by the irreducible polynomial $a$ over $\F_p$. The
 coefficients of $x$ must be operation-compatible with $\Z/p\Z$.
 Either $a$ or $p$ can omitted (in which case both are ignored) if x has
 \typ{FFELT} coefficients:
 \bprog

Function: polrootsmod

C-Name: rootmod0
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: polrootsmod(pol,p,{flag=0}): roots mod the prime p of the polynomial pol. flag is
 optional, and can be 0: default, or 1: use a naive search, useful for small p.
Description: 
 (pol, int, ?0):vec           rootmod($1, $2)
 (pol, int, 1):vec            rootmod2($1, $2)
 (pol, int, #small):vec       $"Bad flag in polrootsmod"
 (pol, int, small):vec        rootmod0($1, $2, $3)
Doc: row vector of roots modulo $p$ of the polynomial \var{pol}. The
 particular non-prime value $p=4$ is accepted, mainly for $2$-adic
 computations. Multiple roots are \emph{not} repeated.
 \bprog
 ? polrootsmod(x^2-1,2)
 %1 = [Mod(1, 2)]~
 ? polrootsmod(x^2-1,4)
 %2 = [Mod(1, 4), Mod(3, 4)]~
 @eprog\noindent
 If $p$ is very small, you may set $\fl=1$, which uses a naive search.

Function: polrootspadic
Class: basic
Section: polynomials
C-Name: rootpadic
Prototype: GGL
Help: polrootspadic(x,p,r): p-adic roots of the polynomial x to precision r.
Doc: row vector of $p$-adic roots of
 the polynomial \var{pol}, given to $p$-adic precision $r$. Multiple roots are
 \emph{not} repeated. $p$ is assumed to be a prime, and \var{pol} to be
 non-zero modulo $p$. Note that this is not the same as the roots in
 $\Z/p^r\Z$, rather it gives approximations in $\Z/p^r\Z$ of the true
 roots living in $\Q_p$.
 
 If \var{pol} has inexact \typ{PADIC} coefficients, this is not always
 well-defined; in this case, the equation is first made integral, then lifted
 to $\Z$. Hence the roots given are approximations of the roots of a
 polynomial which is $p$-adically close to the input.

Function: polsturm

C-Name: sturmpart
Prototype: lGDGDG
Help: polsturm(pol,{a},{b}): number of real roots of the squarefree polynomial
 pol in the interval ]a,b] (which are respectively taken to be -oo or +oo when
 omitted).
Doc: number of real roots of the real squarefree polynomial \var{pol} in the
 interval $]a,b]$, using Sturm's algorithm. $a$ (resp.~$b$) is taken to be
 $-\infty$ (resp.~$+\infty$) if omitted.
Variant: Also available is \fun{long}{sturm}{GEN pol} (total number of real

Function: polsubcyclo

C-Name: polsubcyclo

Help: polsubcyclo(n,d,{v=x}): finds an equation (in variable v) for the d-th
 degree subfields of Q(zeta_n). Output is a polynomial or a vector of
 polynomials is there are several such fields, or none.
Doc: gives polynomials (in variable
 $v$) defining the sub-Abelian extensions of degree $d$ of the cyclotomic
 field $\Q(\zeta_n)$, where $d\mid \phi(n)$.
 
 If there is exactly one such extension the output is a polynomial, else it is
 a vector of polynomials, possibly empty. To get a vector in all cases,
 use \kbd{concat([], polsubcyclo(n,d))}
 
 The function \tet{galoissubcyclo} allows to specify more closely which
 sub-Abelian extension should be computed.

C-Name: sylvestermatrix
Prototype: GG
Help: polsylvestermatrix(x,y): forms the sylvester matrix associated to the
 two polynomials x and y. Warning: the polynomial coefficients are in
 columns, not in rows.
Doc: forms the Sylvester matrix
 corresponding to the two polynomials $x$ and $y$, where the coefficients of
 the polynomials are put in the columns of the matrix (which is the natural
 direction for solving equations afterwards). The use of this matrix can be
 essential when dealing with polynomials with inexact entries, since
 polynomial Euclidean division doesn't make much sense in this case.

Function: polsym

Prototype: G
Help: poltschirnhaus(x): random Tschirnhausen transformation of the

Doc: applies a random Tschirnhausen
 transformation to the polynomial $x$, which is assumed to be non-constant
 and separable, so as to obtain a new equation for the \'etale algebra
 defined by $x$. This is for instance useful when computing resolvents,
 hence is used by the \kbd{polgalois} function.

Function: polylog

C-Name: polylog0
Prototype: LGD0,L,p
Help: polylog(m,x,{flag=0}): m-th polylogarithm of x. flag is optional, and
 can be 0: default, 1: D_m~-modified m-th polylog of x, 2: D_m-modified m-th
 polylog of x, 3: P_m-modified m-th polylog of x.
Doc: one of the different polylogarithms, depending on \fl:
 
 If $\fl=0$ or is omitted: $m^\text{th}$ polylogarithm of $x$, i.e.~analytic
 continuation of the power series $\text{Li}_m(x)=\sum_{n\ge1}x^n/n^m$
 ($x < 1$). Uses the functional equation linking the values at $x$ and $1/x$
 to restrict to the case $|x|\leq 1$, then the power series when
 $|x|^2\le1/2$, and the power series expansion in $\log(x)$ otherwise.
 
 Using $\fl$, computes a modified $m^\text{th}$ polylogarithm of $x$.
 We use Zagier's notations; let $\Re_m$ denote $\Re$ or $\Im$ depending
 on whether $m$ is odd or even:
 
 If $\fl=1$: compute $\tilde D_m(x)$, defined for $|x|\le1$ by
 $$\Re_m\left(\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} \dfrac{(-\log|x|)^k}{k!}\text{Li}_{m-k}(x)
 +\dfrac{(-\log|x|)^{m-1}}{m!}\log|1-x|\right).$$
 
 If $\fl=2$: compute $D_m(x)$, defined for $|x|\le1$ by
 $$\Re_m\left(\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\dfrac{(-\log|x|)^k}{k!}\text{Li}_{m-k}(x)
 -\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{(-\log|x|)^m}{m!}\right).$$
 
 If $\fl=3$: compute $P_m(x)$, defined for $|x|\le1$ by
 $$\Re_m\left(\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}\dfrac{2^kB_k}{k!}(\log|x|)^k\text{Li}_{m-k}(x)
 -\dfrac{2^{m-1}B_m}{m!}(\log|x|)^m\right).$$
 
 These three functions satisfy the functional equation
 $f_m(1/x) = (-1)^{m-1}f_m(x)$.

Function: precision

 (real,small):real     precision0($1, $2)
 (gen,small):gen       precision0($1, $2)
Doc: gives the precision in decimal digits of the PARI object $x$. If $x$ is
 an exact object, the largest single precision integer is returned.
 \bprog
 ? precision(exp(1e-100))
 %1 = 134                \\ 134 significant decimal digits
 ? precision(2 + x)
 %2 = 2147483647         \\ exact object
 ? precision(0.5 + O(x))
 %3 = 28                 \\ floating point accuracy, NOT series precision
 ? precision( [ exp(1e-100), 0.5 ] )
 %4 = 28                 \\ minimal accuracy among components
 @eprog\noindent
 The return value for exact objects is meaningless since it is not even the
 same on 32 and 64-bit machines. The proper way to test whether an object is
 exact is
 \bprog
 ? isexact(x) = precision(x) == precision(0)
 @eprog
 
 If $n$ is not omitted, creates a new object equal to $x$ with a new
 ``precision'' $n$. (This never changes the type of the result. In particular
 it is not possible to use it to obtain a polynomial from a power series; tor
 that, see \tet{truncate}.) Now the meaning of precision is different from the
 above (floating point accuracy), and depends on the type of $x$:
 
 For exact types, no change. For $x$ a vector or a matrix, the operation is
 done componentwise.
 
 For real $x$, $n$ is the number of desired significant \emph{decimal}
 digits. If $n$ is smaller than the precision of $x$, $x$ is truncated,
 otherwise $x$ is extended with zeros.
 
 For $x$ a $p$-adic or a power series, $n$ is the desired number of
 \emph{significant} $p$-adic or $X$-adic digits, where $X$ is the main
 variable of $x$. (Note: yes, this is inconsistent.)
 Note that the precision is a priori distinct from the exponent $k$ appearing
 in $O(*^k)$; it is indeed equal to $k$ if and only if $x$ is a $p$-adic
 or $X$-adic \emph{unit}.
 \bprog
 ? precision(1 + O(x), 10)
 %1 = 1 + O(x^10)
 ? precision(x^2 + O(x^10), 3)
 %2 = x^2 + O(x^5)
 ? precision(7^2 + O(7^10), 3)
 %3 = 7^2 + O(7^5)
 @eprog\noindent
 For the last two examples, note that $x^2 + O(x^5) = x^2(1 + O(x^3))$
 indeed has 3 significant coefficients
Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{gprec}{GEN x, long n} and
 \fun{long}{precision}{GEN x}. In both, the accuracy is expressed in
 \emph{words} (32-bit or 64-bit depending on the architecture).

Doc: finds the largest pseudoprime (see
 \tet{ispseudoprime}) less than or equal to $x$. $x$ can be of any real type.
 Returns 0 if $x\le1$. Note that if $x$ is a prime, this function returns $x$
 and not the largest prime strictly smaller than $x$. To rigorously prove that
 the result is prime, use \kbd{isprime}.

C-Name: printf0
Prototype: vss*
Help: printf(fmt,{x}*): prints its arguments according to the format fmt.
Doc: This function is based on the C library command of the same name.
 It prints its arguments according to the format \var{fmt}, which specifies how
 subsequent arguments are converted for output. The format is a
 character string composed of zero or more directives:
 
 \item ordinary characters (not \kbd{\%}), printed unchanged,
 
 \item conversions specifications (\kbd{\%} followed by some characters)
 which fetch one argument from the list and prints it according to the
 specification.
 
 More precisely, a conversion specification consists in a \kbd{\%}, one or more
 optional flags (among \kbd{\#}, \kbd{0}, \kbd{-}, \kbd{+}, ` '), an optional
 decimal digit string specifying a minimal field width, an optional precision
 in the form of a period (`\kbd{.}') followed by a decimal digit string, and
 the conversion specifier (among \kbd{d},\kbd{i}, \kbd{o}, \kbd{u},
 \kbd{x},\kbd{X}, \kbd{p}, \kbd{e},\kbd{E}, \kbd{f}, \kbd{g},\kbd{G}, \kbd{s}).
 
 \misctitle{The flag characters} The character \kbd{\%} is followed by zero or
 more of the following flags:
 
 \item \kbd{\#}: The value is converted to an ``alternate form''. For
 \kbd{o} conversion (octal), a \kbd{0} is prefixed to the string. For \kbd{x}
 and \kbd{X} conversions (hexa), respectively \kbd{0x} and \kbd{0X} are
 prepended. For other conversions, the flag is ignored.
 
 \item \kbd{0}: The value should be zero padded. For
 \kbd{d},
 \kbd{i},
 \kbd{o},
 \kbd{u},
 \kbd{x},
 \kbd{X}
 \kbd{e},
 \kbd{E},
 \kbd{f},
 \kbd{F},
 \kbd{g}, and
 \kbd{G} conversions, the value is padded on the left with zeros rather than
 blanks. (If the \kbd{0} and \kbd{-} flags both appear, the \kbd{0} flag is
 ignored.)
 
 \item \kbd{-}: The value is left adjusted on the field boundary. (The
 default is right justification.) The value is padded on the right with
 blanks, rather than on the left with blanks or zeros. A \kbd{-} overrides a
 \kbd{0} if both are given.
 
 \item \kbd{` '} (a space): A blank is left before a positive number
 produced by a signed conversion.
 
 \item \kbd{+}: A sign (+ or -) is placed before a number produced by a
 signed conversion. A \kbd{+} overrides a space if both are used.
 
 \misctitle{The field width} An optional decimal digit string (whose first
 digit is non-zero) specifying a \emph{minimum} field width. If the value has
 fewer characters than the field width, it is padded with spaces on the left
 (or right, if the left-adjustment flag has been given). In no case does a
 small field width cause truncation of a field; if the value is wider than
 the field width, the field is expanded to contain the conversion result.
 Instead of a decimal digit string, one may write \kbd{*} to specify that the
 field width is given in the next argument.
 
 \misctitle{The precision} An optional precision in the form of a period
 (`\kbd{.}') followed by a decimal digit string. This gives
 the number of digits to appear after the radix character for \kbd{e},
 \kbd{E}, \kbd{f}, and \kbd{F} conversions, the maximum number of significant
 digits for \kbd{g} and \kbd{G} conversions, and the maximum number of
 characters to be printed from an \kbd{s} conversion.
 Instead of a decimal digit string, one may write \kbd{*} to specify that the
 field width is given in the next argument.
 
 \misctitle{The length modifier} This is ignored under \kbd{gp}, but
 necessary for \kbd{libpari} programming. Description given here for
 completeness:
 
 \item \kbd{l}: argument is a \kbd{long} integer.
 
 \item \kbd{P}: argument is a \kbd{GEN}.
 
 \misctitle{The conversion specifier} A character that specifies the type of
 conversion to be applied.
 
 \item \kbd{d}, \kbd{i}: A signed integer.
 
 \item \kbd{o}, \kbd{u}, \kbd{x}, \kbd{X}: An unsigned integer, converted
 to unsigned octal (\kbd{o}), decimal (\kbd{u}) or hexadecimal (\kbd{x} or
 \kbd{X}) notation. The letters \kbd{abcdef} are used for \kbd{x}
 conversions;  the letters \kbd{ABCDEF} are used for \kbd{X} conversions.
 
 \item \kbd{e}, \kbd{E}: The (real) argument is converted in the style
 \kbd{[ -]d.ddd e[ -]dd}, where there is one digit before the decimal point,
 and the number of digits after it is equal to the precision; if the
 precision is missing, use the current \kbd{realprecision} for the total
 number of printed digits. If the precision is explicitly 0, no decimal-point
 character appears. An \kbd{E} conversion uses the letter \kbd{E} rather
 than \kbd{e} to introduce the exponent.
 
 \item \kbd{f}, \kbd{F}: The (real) argument is converted in the style
 \kbd{[ -]ddd.ddd}, where the number of digits after the decimal point
 is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, use the current
 \kbd{realprecision} for the total number of printed digits. If the precision
 is explicitly 0, no decimal-point character appears. If a decimal point
 appears, at least one digit appears before it.
 
 \item \kbd{g}, \kbd{G}: The (real) argument is converted in style
 \kbd{e} or \kbd{f} (or \kbd{E} or \kbd{F} for \kbd{G} conversions)
 \kbd{[ -]ddd.ddd}, where the total number of digits printed
 is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, use the current
 \kbd{realprecision}. If the precision is explicitly 0, it is treated as 1.
 Style \kbd{e} is used when
 the decimal exponent is $< -4$, to print \kbd{0.}, or when the integer
 part cannot be decided given the known significant digits, and the \kbd{f}
 format otherwise.
 
 \item \kbd{c}: The integer argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the
 resulting character is written.
 
 \item \kbd{s}: Convert to a character string. If a precision is given, no
 more than the specified number of characters are written.
 
 \item \kbd{p}: Print the address of the argument in hexadecimal (as if by
 \kbd{\%\#x}).
 
 \item \kbd{\%}: A \kbd{\%} is written. No argument is converted. The complete
 conversion specification is \kbd{\%\%}.

 \bprog
 ? printf("floor: %d, field width 3: %3d, with sign: %+3d\n", Pi, 1, 2);

 ? printf("%.2f  |%06.2f|", Pi,Pi)
 3.14  |  3.14|
 @eprog\noindent All numerical conversions apply recursively to the entries
 of vectors and matrices:
 \bprog
 ? printf("%4d", [1,2,3]);
 [   1,   2,   3]
 ? printf("%5.2f", mathilbert(3));
 [ 1.00  0.50  0.33]
 
 [ 0.50  0.33  0.25]
 
 [ 0.33  0.25  0.20]
 @eprog
 \misctitle{Technical note} Our implementation of \tet{printf}
 deviates from the C89 and C99 standards in a few places:
 
 \item whenever a precision is missing, the current \kbd{realprecision} is
 used to determine the number of printed digits (C89: use 6 decimals after
 the radix character).
 
 \item in conversion style \kbd{e}, we do not impose that the
 exponent has at least two digits; we never write a \kbd{+} sign in the
 exponent; 0 is printed in a special way, always as \kbd{0.E\var{exp}}.
 
 \item in conversion style \kbd{f}, we switch to style \kbd{e} if the
 exponent is greater or equal to the precision.
 
 \item in conversion \kbd{g} and \kbd{G}, we do not remove trailing zeros
  from the fractional part of the result; nor a trailing decimal point;
  0 is printed in a special way, always as \kbd{0.E\var{exp}}.

C-Name: qfbclassno0
Prototype: GD0,L,
Help: qfbclassno(D,{flag=0}): class number of discriminant D using Shanks's
 method by default. If (optional) flag is set to 1, use Euler products.
Doc: ordinary class number of the quadratic
 order of discriminant $D$. In the present version \vers, a $O(D^{1/2})$
 algorithm is used for $D > 0$ (using Euler product and the functional
 equation) so $D$ should not be too large, say $D < 10^8$, for the time to be
 reasonable. On the other hand, for $D < 0$ one can reasonably compute
 \kbd{qfbclassno($D$)} for $|D|<10^{25}$, since the routine uses
 \idx{Shanks}'s method which is in $O(|D|^{1/4})$. For larger values of $|D|$,
 see \kbd{quadclassunit}.
 
 If $\fl=1$, compute the class number using \idx{Euler product}s and the
 functional equation. However, it is in $O(|D|^{1/2})$.
 
 \misctitle{Important warning} For $D < 0$, this function may give incorrect
 results when the class group has many cyclic factors,
 because implementing \idx{Shanks}'s method in full generality slows it down
 immensely. It is therefore strongly recommended to double-check results using
 either the version with $\fl = 1$ or the function \kbd{quadclassunit}.
 
 \misctitle{Warning} Contrary to what its name implies, this routine does not
 compute the number of classes of binary primitive forms of discriminant $D$,
 which is equal to the \emph{narrow} class number. The two notions are the same
 when $D < 0$ or the fundamental unit $\varepsilon$ has negative norm; when $D
 > 0$ and $N\varepsilon > 0$, the number of classes of forms is twice the
 ordinary class number. This is a problem which we cannot fix for backward
 compatibility reasons. Use the following routine if you are only interested
 in the number of classes of forms:
 \bprog
 QFBclassno(D) =
 qfbclassno(D) * if (D < 0 || norm(quadunit(D)) < 0, 1, 2)
 @eprog\noindent
 Here are a few examples:
 \bprog

 the common discriminant of $x$ and $y$. When $x$ and $y$ do not have the same
 discriminant, the result is undefined.

 Let $D = \disc Q$. The algorithm used runs in probabilistic polynomial time

 polynomial time in $D$ if $Q$ is imaginary, but exponential time if $Q$ is

Doc: \idx{LLL} algorithm applied to the
 \emph{columns} of the matrix $x$. The columns of $x$ may be linearly
 dependent. The result is a unimodular transformation matrix $T$ such that $x
 \cdot T$ is an LLL-reduced basis of the lattice generated by the column
 vectors of $x$. Note that if $x$ is not of maximal rank $T$ will not be
 square. The LLL parameters are $(0.51,0.99)$, meaning that the Gram-Schmidt
 coefficients for the final basis satisfy $\mu_{i,j} \leq |0.51|$, and the
 Lov\'{a}sz's constant is $0.99$.
 
 If $\fl=0$ (default), assume that $x$ has either exact (integral or
 rational) or real floating point entries. The matrix is rescaled, converted
 to integers and the behavior is then as in $\fl = 1$.
 
 If $\fl=1$, assume that $x$ is integral. Computations involving Gram-Schmidt
 vectors are approximate, with precision varying as needed (Lehmer's trick,
 as generalized by Schnorr). Adapted from Nguyen and Stehl\'e's algorithm
 and Stehl\'e's code (\kbd{fplll-1.3}).
 
 If $\fl=2$, $x$ should be an integer matrix whose columns are linearly
 independent. Returns a partially reduced basis for $x$, using an unpublished
 algorithm by Peter Montgomery: a basis is said to be \emph{partially reduced}
 if $|v_i \pm v_j| \geq |v_i|$ for any two distinct basis vectors $v_i, \,
 v_j$.
 
 This is faster than $\fl=1$, esp. when one row is huge compared
 to the other rows (knapsack-style), and should quickly produce relatively
 short vectors. The resulting basis is \emph{not} LLL-reduced in general.
 If LLL reduction is eventually desired, avoid this partial reduction:
 applying LLL to the partially reduced matrix is significantly \emph{slower}
 than starting from a knapsack-type lattice.
 
 If $\fl=4$, as $\fl=1$, returning a vector $[K, T]$ of matrices: the
 columns of $K$ represent a basis of the integer kernel of $x$
 (not LLL-reduced in general) and $T$ is the transformation
 matrix such that $x\cdot T$ is an LLL-reduced $\Z$-basis of the image
 of the matrix $x$.
 
 If $\fl=5$, case as case $4$, but $x$ may have polynomial coefficients.
 
 If $\fl=8$, same as case $0$, but $x$ may have polynomial coefficients.

 coefficients, 8: same as 0 but x may have polynomial coefficients.
Doc: same as \kbd{qflll}, except that the
 matrix $G = \kbd{x\til * x}$ is the Gram matrix of some lattice vectors $x$,
 and not the coordinates of the vectors themselves. In particular, $G$ must
 now be a square symmetric real matrix, corresponding to a positive
 quadratic form (not necessarily definite: $x$ needs not have maximal rank).
 The result is a unimodular
 transformation matrix $T$ such that $x \cdot T$ is an LLL-reduced basis of
 the lattice generated by the column vectors of $x$. See \tet{qflll} for
 further details about the LLL implementation.
 
 If $\fl=0$ (default), assume that $G$ has either exact (integral or
 rational) or real floating point entries. The matrix is rescaled, converted
 to integers and the behavior is then as in $\fl = 1$.
 
 If $\fl=1$, assume that $G$ is integral. Computations involving Gram-Schmidt
 vectors are approximate, with precision varying as needed (Lehmer's trick,
 as generalized by Schnorr). Adapted from Nguyen and Stehl\'e's algorithm
 and Stehl\'e's code (\kbd{fplll-1.3}).
 
 $\fl=4$: $G$ has integer entries, gives the kernel and reduced image of $x$.
 
 $\fl=5$: same as $4$, but $G$ may have polynomial coefficients.
Variant: Also available are \fun{GEN}{lllgram}{GEN G} ($\fl=0$),
 \fun{GEN}{lllgramint}{GEN G} ($\fl=1$), and \fun{GEN}{lllgramkerim}{GEN G}

Function: qfminim
Class: basic
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: qfminim0
Prototype: GDGDGD0,L,p
Help: qfminim(x,{b},{m},{flag=0}): x being a square and symmetric
 matrix representing a positive definite quadratic form, this function
 deals with the vectors of x whose norm is less than or equal to b,
 enumerated using the Fincke-Pohst algorithm, storing at most m vectors (no
 limit if m is omitted). The function searches for
 the minimal non-zero vectors if b is omitted. The precise behavior
 depends on flag. 0: seeks at most 2m vectors (unless m omitted), returns
 [N,M,mat] where N is the number of vectors found, M the maximum norm among
 these, and mat lists half the vectors (the other half is given by -mat). 1:
 ignores m and returns the first vector whose norm is less than b. 2: as 0
 but uses a more robust, slower implementation, valid for non integral
 quadratic forms.
Doc: $x$ being a square and symmetric matrix representing a positive definite
 quadratic form, this function deals with the vectors of $x$ whose norm is
 less than or equal to $b$, enumerated using the Fincke-Pohst algorithm,
 storing at most $m$ vectors (no limit if $m$ is omitted). The function
 searches for the minimal non-zero vectors if $b$ is omitted. The behavior is
 undefined if $x$ is not positive definite (a ``precision too low'' error is
 most likely, although more precise error messages are possible). The precise
 behavior depends on $\fl$.
 
 If $\fl=0$ (default), seeks at most $2m$ vectors. The result is a
 three-component vector, the first component being the number of vectors
 found, the second being the maximum norm found, and the last vector is a
 matrix whose columns are the vectors found, only one being given for each
 pair $\pm v$ (at most $m$ such pairs, unless $m$ was omitted). The vectors
 are returned in no particular order.
 
 If $\fl=1$, ignores $m$ and returns the first vector whose norm is less
 than $b$. In this variant, an explicit $b$ must be provided.
 
 In these two cases, $x$ must have \emph{integral} entries. The
 implementation uses low precision floating point computations for maximal
 speed, which gives incorrect result when $x$ has large entries. (The
 condition is checked in the code and the routine raises an error if
 large rounding errors occur.) A more robust, but much slower,
 implementation is chosen if the following flag is used:
 
 If $\fl=2$, $x$ can have non integral real entries. In this case, if $b$
 is omitted, the ``minimal'' vectors only have approximately the same norm.
 If $b$ is omitted, $m$ is an upper bound for the number of vectors that
 will be stored and returned, but all minimal vectors are nevertheless
 enumerated. If $m$ is omitted, all vectors found are stored and returned;
 note that this may be a huge vector!

Prototype: G
Help: qfperfection(G): rank of matrix of xx~ for x minimal vectors of a gram

Doc: 
 $G$ being a square and symmetric matrix with
 integer entries representing a positive definite quadratic form, outputs the
 perfection rank of the form. That is, gives the rank of the family of the $s$
 symmetric matrices $v_iv_i^t$, where $s$ is half the number of minimal
 vectors and the $v_i$ ($1\le i\le s$) are the minimal vectors.
 
 Since this requires computing the minimal vectors, the computations can
 become very lengthy as the dimension of $x$ grows.

Function: quadclassunit
Class: basic
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: quadclassunit0
Prototype: GD0,L,DGp
Help: quadclassunit(D,{flag=0},{tech=[]}): compute the structure of the
 class group and the regulator of the quadratic field of discriminant D.
 See manual for the optional technical parameters.
Doc: \idx{Buchmann-McCurley}'s sub-exponential algorithm for computing the
 class group of a quadratic order of discriminant $D$.
 
 This function should be used instead of \tet{qfbclassno} or \tet{quadregula}
 when $D<-10^{25}$, $D>10^{10}$, or when the \emph{structure} is wanted. It
 is a special case of \tet{bnfinit}, which is slower, but more robust.
 
 The result is a vector $v$ whose components should be accessed using member
 functions:
 
 \item \kbd{$v$.no}: the class number
 
 \item \kbd{$v$.cyc}: a vector giving the structure of the class group as a
 product of cyclic groups;
 
 \item \kbd{$v$.gen}: a vector giving generators of those cyclic groups (as
 binary quadratic forms).
 
 \item \kbd{$v$.reg}: the regulator, computed to an accuracy which is the
 maximum of an internal accuracy determined by the program and the current
 default (note that once the regulator is known to a small accuracy it is
 trivial to compute it to very high accuracy, see the tutorial).
 
 The $\fl$ is obsolete and should be left alone. In older versions,
 it supposedly computed the narrow class group when $D>0$, but this did not
 work at all; use the general function \tet{bnfnarrow}.
 
 Optional parameter \var{tech} is a row vector of the form $[c_1, c_2]$,
 where $c_1 \leq c_2$ are positive real numbers which control the execution
 time and the stack size, see \ref{se:GRHbnf}. The parameter is used as a
 threshold to balance the relation finding phase against the final linear
 algebra. Increasing the default $c_1 = 0.2$ means that relations are easier
 to find, but more relations are needed and the linear algebra will be
 harder. The parameter $c_2$ is mostly obsolete and should not be changed,
 but we still document it for completeness: we compute a tentative class
 group by generators and relations using a factorbase of prime ideals $\leq
 c_1 (\log |D|)^2$, then prove that ideals of norm $\leq c_2 (\log |D|)^2$ do
 not generate a larger group. By default an optimal $c_2$ is chosen, so that
 the result is provably correct under the GRH --- a famous result of Bach
 states that $c_2 = 6$ is fine, but it is possible to improve on this
 algorithmically. You may provide a smaller $c_2$, it will be ignored
 (we use the provably correct
 one); you may provide a larger $c_2$ than the default value, which results
 in longer computing times for equally correct outputs (under GRH).
Variant: If you really need to experiment with the \var{tech} parameter, it is
 usually more convenient to use

 of the field. If $D$ is not a fundamental discriminant, this probably gives
 the fundamental unit of the corresponding order. $D$ must be an integer

Doc: 
 returns a random element in various natural sets depending on the
 argument $N$.
 
 \item \typ{INT}: returns an integer
 uniformly distributed between $0$ and $N-1$. Omitting the argument
 is equivalent to \kbd{random(2\pow31)}.
 
 \item \typ{REAL}: returns a real number in $[0,1[$ with the same accuracy as
 $N$ (whose mantissa has the same number of significant words).
 
 \item \typ{INTMOD}: returns a random intmod for the same modulus.
 
 \item \typ{FFELT}: returns a random element in the same finite field.
 
 \item \typ{VEC} generated by \kbd{ellinit} over a finite field $k$
 (coefficients are \typ{INTMOD}s modulo a prime or \typ{FFELT}s): returns a
 random $k$-rational \emph{affine} point on the curve. More precisely an
 abscissa is drawn uniformly at random until \tet{ellordinate} succeeds.
 In particular, the curves over $\F_2$ with a single point (at infinity!)
 will trigger an infinite loop. Note that this is definitely not a uniform
 distribution over $E(k)$.
 
 \item \typ{POL} return a random polynomial of degree at most the degree of $N$.
 The coefficients are drawn by applying \kbd{random} to the leading
 coefficient of $N$.

 These variants all depend on a single internal generator, and are
 independent from the system's random number generator.
 A random seed may be obtained via \tet{getrand}, and reset
 using \tet{setrand}: from a given seed, and given sequence of \kbd{random}s,
 the exact same values will be generated. The same seed is used at each
 startup, reseed the generator yourself if this is a problem.
 
 \misctitle{Technical note}
 Up to
 version 2.4 included, the internal generator produced pseudo-random numbers
 by means of linear congruences, which were not well distributed in arithmetic
 progressions. We now
 use Brent's XORGEN algorithm, based on Feedback Shift Registers, see
 \kbd{http://wwwmaths.anu.edu.au/\til{}brent/random.html}. The generator has period
 $2^{4096}-1$, passes the Crush battery of statistical tests of L'Ecuyer and
 Simard, but is not suitable for cryptographic purposes: one can reconstruct
 the state vector from a small sample of consecutive values, thus predicting
 the entire sequence.

Function: rnfdedekind
Class: basic

C-Name: rnfdedekind
Prototype: GGDGD0,L,
Help: rnfdedekind(nf,pol,{pr},{flag=0}): relative Dedekind criterion over the
 number field K, represented by nf, applied to the order O_K[X]/(P),
 modulo the prime ideal pr (at all primes if pr omitted, in which case
 flag is automatically set to 1).
 P is assumed to be monic, irreducible, in O_K[X].
 Returns [max,basis,v], where basis is a pseudo-basis of the
 enlarged order, max is 1 iff this order is pr-maximal, and v is the
 valuation at pr of the order discriminant. If flag is set, just return 1 if
 the order is maximal, and 0 if not.
Doc: given a number field $K$ coded by $\var{nf}$ and a monic
 polynomial $P\in \Z_K[X]$, irreducible over $K$ and thus defining a relative
 extension $L$ of $K$, applies \idx{Dedekind}'s criterion to the order
 $\Z_K[X]/(P)$, at the prime ideal \var{pr}. It is possible to set \var{pr}
 to a vector of prime ideals (test maximality at all primes in the vector),
 or to omit altogether, in which case maximality at \emph{all} primes is tested;
 in this situation \fl\ is automatically set to $1$.
 
 The default historic behavior (\fl\ is 0 or omitted and \var{pr} is a
 single prime ideal) is not so useful since
 \kbd{rnfpseudobasis} gives more information and is generally not that
 much slower. It returns a 3-component vector $[\var{max}, \var{basis}, v]$:
 
 \item \var{basis} is a pseudo-basis of an enlarged order $O$ produced by
 Dedekind's criterion, containing the original order $\Z_K[X]/(P)$
 with index a power of \var{pr}. Possibly equal to the original order.
 
 \item \var{max} is a flag equal to 1 if the enlarged order $O$
 could be proven to be \var{pr}-maximal and to 0 otherwise; it may still be
 maximal in the latter case if \var{pr} is ramified in $L$,
 
 \item $v$ is the valuation at \var{pr} of the order discriminant.
 
 If \fl\ is non-zero, on the other hand, we just return $1$ if the order
 $\Z_K[X]/(P)$ is \var{pr}-maximal (resp.~maximal at all relevant primes, as
 described above), and $0$ if not. This is much faster than the default,
 since the enlarged order is not computed.
 \bprog

 ? rnfdedekind(nf, P, pr3, 1)
 %3 = 1
 @eprog\noindent In this example, \kbd{pr3} is the ramified ideal above $3$,
 and the order generated by the cube roots of $y$ is already
 \kbd{pr3}-maximal. The order-discriminant has valuation $8$. On the other
 hand, the order is not maximal at the prime above 2:
 \bprog

      [1, 1/2; 0, 1/2]]], 2]
 @eprog
 The enlarged order is not proven to be \kbd{pr2}-maximal yet. In fact, it
 is; it is in fact the maximal order:
 \bprog
 ? B = rnfpseudobasis(nf, P)
 %7 = [[1, 0, 0; 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, [1, 1/2; 0, 1/2]],
      [162, 0; 0, 162], -1]
 ? idealval(nf,B[3], pr2)
 %4 = 2
 @eprog\noindent
 It is possible to use this routine with non-monic
 $P = \sum_{i\leq n} a_i X^i \in \Z_K[X]$ if $\fl = 1$;
 in this case, we test maximality of Dedekind's order generated by
 $$1, a_n \alpha, a_n\alpha^2 + a_{n-1}\alpha, \dots,
 a_n\alpha^{n-1} + a_{n-1}\alpha^{n-2} + \cdots + a_1\alpha.$$
 The routine will fail if $P$ is $0$ on the projective line over the residue
 field $\Z_K/\kbd{pr}$ (FIXME).

 (see \secref{se:priority}) than that of $\var{nf}$, and the coefficients of
 \var{pol} must be in $\var{nf}$.
 
 The result is a row vector, whose components are technical. In the following
 description, we let $K$ be the base field defined by $\var{nf}$, $m$ the
 degree of the base field, $n$ the relative degree, $L$ the large field (of
 relative degree $n$ or absolute degree $nm$), $r_1$ and $r_2$ the number of

 $\var{rnf}[3]$ is a two-component row vector $[\goth{d}(L/K),s]$ where
 $\goth{d}(L/K)$ is the relative ideal discriminant of $L/K$ and $s$ is the

 it is the output of \kbd{rnfdisc}.

 $L/\Q$. $\var{vabs}[1]$ is an absolute equation, more conveniently obtained
 as \kbd{rnf.pol}. $\var{vabs}[2]$ expresses the generator $\alpha$ of the
 number field $\var{nf}$ as a polynomial modulo the absolute equation
 $\var{vabs}[1]$. $\var{vabs}[3]$ is a small integer $k$ such that, if $\beta$
 is an abstract root of \var{pol} and $\alpha$ the generator of $\var{nf}$,
 the generator whose root is \var{vabs} will be
 $\beta + k \alpha$. Note that one must be very careful if $k\neq0$ when
 dealing simultaneously with absolute and relative quantities since the
 generator chosen for the absolute extension is not the same as for the
 relative one. If this happens, one can of course go on working, but we
 strongly advise to change the relative polynomial so that its root will be
 $\beta + k \alpha$. Typically, the GP instruction would be
 
 \kbd{pol = subst(pol, x, x - k*Mod(y,\var{nf}.pol))}
 
 $\var{rnf}[12]$ is by default unused and set equal to 0. This
 field is used to store further information about the field as it becomes
 available (which is rarely needed, hence would be too expensive to compute
 during the initial \kbd{rnfinit} call).

 otherwise it is used to add more places to S: all the places above the

 $S$: all the places above the primes $p \leq \fl$ (resp.~$p|\fl$) if $\fl>0$
 (resp.~$\fl<0$).
 
 The answer is guaranteed (i.e.~$a$ is a norm iff $q = 1$) if the field is

 by the polynomial \var{polrel}. As usual, \var{pol} can in fact be an \var{nf},
 or \var{bnf}, etc; if \var{pol} has degree $1$ (the base field is $\Q$),
 polrel is also allowed to be an \var{nf}, etc. Computes technical data needed
 by \tet{rnfisnorm} to solve norm equations $Nx = a$, for $x$ in $L$, and $a$
 in $K$.
 
 If $\fl = 0$, do not care whether $L/K$ is Galois or not.
 
 If $\fl = 1$, $L/K$ is assumed to be Galois (unchecked), which speeds up
 \tet{rnfisnorm}.
 
 If $\fl = 2$, let the routine determine whether $L/K$ is Galois.

Function: rnfkummer
Class: basic
Section: number_fields
C-Name: rnfkummer
Prototype: GDGD0,L,p
Help: rnfkummer(bnr,{subgp},{d=0}): bnr being as output by bnrinit,
 finds a relative equation for the class field corresponding to the module in
 bnr and the given congruence subgroup (the ray class field if subgp is
 omitted). d can be zero (default), or positive, and in this case the
 output is the list of all relative equations of degree d for the given bnr,
 with the same conductor as (bnr, subgp).
Doc: \var{bnr}
 being as output by \kbd{bnrinit}, finds a relative equation for the
 class field corresponding to the module in \var{bnr} and the given
 congruence subgroup (the full ray class field if \var{subgp} is omitted).
 If $d$ is positive, outputs the list of all relative equations of
 degree $d$ contained in the ray class field defined by \var{bnr}, with
 the \emph{same} conductor as $(\var{bnr}, \var{subgp})$.
 
 \misctitle{Warning} This routine only works for subgroups of prime index. It
 uses Kummer theory, adjoining necessary roots of unity (it needs to compute a
 tough \kbd{bnfinit} here), and finds a generator via Hecke's characterization
 of ramification in Kummer extensions of prime degree. If your extension does
 not have prime degree, for the time being, you have to split it by hand as a
 tower / compositum of such extensions.

Function: rnflllgram
Class: basic
Section: number_fields
C-Name: rnflllgram
Prototype: GGGp
Help: rnflllgram(nf,pol,order): given a pol with coefficients in nf and an
 order as output by rnfpseudobasis or similar, gives [[neworder],U], where
 neworder is a reduced order and U is the unimodular transformation matrix.
Doc: given a polynomial
 \var{pol} with coefficients in \var{nf} defining a relative extension $L$ and
 a suborder \var{order} of $L$ (of maximal rank), as output by
 \kbd{rnfpseudobasis}$(\var{nf},\var{pol})$ or similar, gives
 $[[\var{neworder}],U]$, where \var{neworder} is a reduced order and $U$ is
 the unimodular transformation matrix.

C-Name: rnfnormgroup
Prototype: GG
Help: rnfnormgroup(bnr,pol): norm group (or Artin or Takagi group)
 corresponding to the Abelian extension of bnr.bnf defined by pol, where
 the module corresponding to bnr is assumed to be a multiple of the
 conductor. The result is the HNF defining the norm group on the
 generators in bnr.gen.
Doc: 
 \var{bnr} being a big ray
 class field as output by \kbd{bnrinit} and \var{pol} a relative polynomial
 defining an \idx{Abelian extension}, computes the norm group (alias Artin
 or Takagi group) corresponding to the Abelian extension of
 $\var{bnf}=$\kbd{bnr.bnf}
 defined by \var{pol}, where the module corresponding to \var{bnr} is assumed
 to be a multiple of the conductor (i.e.~\var{pol} defines a subextension of
 bnr). The result is the HNF defining the norm group on the given generators
 of \kbd{bnr.gen}. Note that neither the fact that \var{pol} defines an
 Abelian extension nor the fact that the module is a multiple of the conductor
 is checked. The result is undefined if the assumption is not correct.

Function: rnfpolred
Class: basic
Section: number_fields
C-Name: rnfpolred
Prototype: GGp
Help: rnfpolred(nf,pol): given a pol with coefficients in nf, finds a list
 of relative polynomials defining some subfields, hopefully simpler.
Doc: relative version of \kbd{polred}.
 Given a monic polynomial \var{pol} with coefficients in $\var{nf}$, finds a
 list of relative polynomials defining some subfields, hopefully simpler and
 containing the original field. In the present version \vers, this is slower
 and less efficient than \kbd{rnfpolredabs}.

Function: rnfpolredabs
Class: basic
Section: number_fields
C-Name: rnfpolredabs
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: rnfpolredabs(nf,pol,{flag=0}): given a pol with coefficients in nf,
 finds a relative simpler polynomial defining the same field. Binary digits
 of flag mean: 1: return also the element whose characteristic polynomial is
 the given polynomial, 2: return an absolute polynomial, 16: partial
 reduction.
Doc: relative version of
 \kbd{polredabs}. Given a monic polynomial \var{pol} with coefficients in
 $\var{nf}$, finds a simpler relative polynomial defining the same field. The
 binary digits of $\fl$ mean
 
 1: returns $[P,a]$ where $P$ is the default output and $a$ is an
 element expressed on a root of $P$ whose characteristic polynomial is
 \var{pol}
 
 2: returns an absolute polynomial (same as
 {\tt rnfequation(\var{nf},rnfpolredabs(\var{nf},\var{pol}))}
 but faster).
 
 16: possibly use a suborder of the maximal order. This is slower than the
 default when the relative discriminant is smooth, and much faster otherwise.
 See \secref{se:polredabs}.
 
 \misctitle{Remark} In the present implementation, this is both faster and
 much more efficient than \kbd{rnfpolred}, the difference being more
 dramatic than in the absolute case. This is because the implementation of
 \kbd{rnfpolred} is based on (a partial implementation of) an incomplete
 reduction theory of lattices over number fields, the function
 \kbd{rnflllgram}, which deserves to be improved.

Function: rnfpseudobasis
Class: basic
Section: number_fields
C-Name: rnfpseudobasis
Prototype: GG
Help: rnfpseudobasis(nf,pol): given a pol with coefficients in nf, gives a
 4-component vector [A,I,D,d] where [A,I] is a pseudo basis of the maximal
 order in HNF on the power basis, D is the relative ideal discriminant, and d
 is the relative discriminant in nf^*/nf*^2.
Doc: given a number field
 $\var{nf}$ as output by \kbd{nfinit} and a polynomial \var{pol} with
 coefficients in $\var{nf}$ defining a relative extension $L$ of $\var{nf}$,
 computes a pseudo-basis $(A,I)$ for the maximal order $\Z_L$ viewed as a
 $\Z_K$-module, and the relative discriminant of $L$. This is output as a
 four-element row vector $[A,I,D,d]$, where $D$ is the relative ideal
 discriminant and $d$ is the relative discriminant considered as an element of
 $\var{nf}^*/{\var{nf}^*}^2$.

Function: rnfsteinitz
Class: basic
Section: number_fields
C-Name: rnfsteinitz
Prototype: GG
Help: rnfsteinitz(nf,x): given an order x as output by rnfpseudobasis,
 gives [A,I,D,d] where (A,I) is a pseudo basis where all the ideals except
 perhaps the last are trivial.
Doc: given a number field $\var{nf}$ as
 output by \kbd{nfinit} and either a polynomial $x$ with coefficients in
 $\var{nf}$ defining a relative extension $L$ of $\var{nf}$, or a pseudo-basis
 $x$ of such an extension as output for example by \kbd{rnfpseudobasis},
 computes another pseudo-basis $(A,I)$ (not in HNF in general) such that all
 the ideals of $I$ except perhaps the last one are equal to the ring of
 integers of $\var{nf}$, and outputs the four-component row vector $[A,I,D,d]$
 as in \kbd{rnfpseudobasis}. The name of this function comes from the fact
 that the ideal class of the last ideal of $I$, which is well defined, is the
 \idx{Steinitz class} of the $\Z_K$-module $\Z_L$ (its image in $SK_0(\Z_K)$).

Function: round
Class: basic
Section: conversions
C-Name: round0
Prototype: GD&
Help: round(x,{&e}): take the nearest integer to all the coefficients of x.
 If e is present, do not take into account loss of integer part precision,
 and set e = error estimate in bits.
Description: 
 (small):small:parens   $1
 (int):int:copy:parens  $1
 (real):int             roundr($1)
 (mp):int               mpround($1)

 (gen, &small):gen      grndtoi($1, &$2)
 (gen, &int):gen        round0($1, &$2)
Doc: If $x$ is in $\R$, rounds $x$ to the nearest integer (rounding to
 $+\infty$ in case of ties), then and sets $e$ to the number of error bits,
 that is the binary exponent of the difference between the original and the
 rounded value (the ``fractional part''). If the exponent of $x$ is too large
 compared to its precision (i.e.~$e>0$), the result is undefined and an error
 occurs if $e$ was not given.
 
 \misctitle{Important remark} Contrary to the other truncation functions,
 this function operates on every coefficient at every level of a PARI object.
 For example
 $$\text{truncate}\left(\dfrac{2.4*X^2-1.7}{X}\right)=2.4*X,$$
 whereas
 $$\text{round}\left(\dfrac{2.4*X^2-1.7}{X}\right)=\dfrac{2*X^2-2}{X}.$$
 An important use of \kbd{round} is to get exact results after an approximate
 computation, when theory tells you that the coefficients must be integers.

 \fun{GEN}{ground}{GEN x}.

Function: select

Prototype: GG
Help: select(f, A): selects elements of A according to the selection function f.
Wrapper: (bG)
Description: 
  (gen,gen):gen    genselect(${1 cookie}, ${1 wrapper}, $2)
Doc: Given a vector, list or matrix \kbd{A} and a \typ{CLOSURE} \kbd{f},
 returns the elements $x$ of \kbd{A} such that $f(x)$ is non-zero. In other
 words, \kbd{f} is seen as a selection function returning a boolean value.
 \bprog
 ? select(x->isprime(x), vector(50,i,i^2+1))
 %1 = [2, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197, 257, 401, 577, 677, 1297, 1601]
 ? select(x->(x<100), %)
 %2 = [2, 5, 17, 37]
 @eprog\noindent returns the primes of the form $i^2+1$ for some $i\leq 50$,
 then the elements less than 100 in the preceding result. The following
 function lists the elements in $(\Z/N\Z)^*$:
 \bprog
 ? invertibles(N) = select(x->gcd(x,N) == 1, vector(N,i,i))
 @eprog
 
 \noindent Finally
 \bprog
 ? select(x->x, M)
 @eprog\noindent selects the non-0 entries in \kbd{M}. If the latter is a
 \typ{MAT}, we extract the matrix of non-0 columns. Note that \emph{removing}
 entries instead of selecting them just involves replacing the selection
 function \kbd{f} with its negation:
 \bprog

Help: serconvol(x,y): convolution (or Hadamard product) of two power series.
Doc: convolution (or \idx{Hadamard product}) of the
 two power series $x$ and $y$; in other words if $x=\sum a_k*X^k$ and $y=\sum
 b_k*X^k$ then $\kbd{serconvol}(x,y)=\sum a_k*b_k*X^k$.

Function: serlaplace
Class: basic
Section: polynomials
C-Name: laplace
Prototype: G
Help: serlaplace(x): replaces the power series sum of a_n*x^n/n! by sum of
 a_n*x^n. For the reverse operation, use serconvol(x,exp(X)).
Doc: $x$ must be a power series with non-negative
 exponents. If $x=\sum (a_k/k!)*X^k$ then the result is $\sum a_k*X^k$.

Function: serreverse
Class: basic
Section: polynomials
C-Name: recip
Prototype: G
Help: serreverse(x): reversion of the power series x.
Doc: reverse power series (i.e.~$x^{-1}$, not $1/x$)

Function: setintersect

C-Name: setintersect
Prototype: GG
Help: setintersect(x,y): intersection of the sets x and y.
Description: 
 (vec, vec):vec        setintersect($1, $2)
Doc: intersection of the two sets $x$ and $y$ (see \kbd{setisset}).
 The function also works if both $x$ and $y$ are vectors of strictly increasing
 entries, according to \kbd{<}); in that case we return a vector of strictly
 increasing entries, not a set. Otherwise, the result is undefined.

Function: setisset
Class: basic
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: setisset
Prototype: lG
Help: setisset(x): true(1) if x is a set (row vector with strictly
 increasing entries), false(0) if not.
Doc: 
 returns true (1) if $x$ is a set, false (0) if
 not. In PARI, a set is a row vector whose entries are strictly
 increasing \typ{STR}s. To convert any object into a set (this is most useful for
 vectors, of course), use the function \kbd{Set}.
 \bprog

Description: 
 (vec, vec):vec        setminus($1, $2)
Doc: difference of the two sets $x$ and $y$ (see \kbd{setisset}),
 i.e.~set of elements of $x$ which do not belong to $y$.
 The function also works if both $x$ and $y$ are vectors of strictly increasing
 entries, according to \kbd{<}); in that case we return a vector of strictly
 increasing entries, not a set. Otherwise, the result is undefined.

Function: setrand
Class: basic
Section: programming/specific
C-Name: setrand
Prototype: vG
Help: setrand(n): reset the seed of the random number generator to n.
Doc: reseeds the random number generator using the seed $n$. No value is
 returned. The seed is either a technical array output by \kbd{getrand}, or a
 small positive integer, used to generate deterministically a suitable state
 array. For instance, running a randomized computation starting by
 \kbd{setrand(1)} twice will generate the exact same output.

Function: setsearch
Class: basic
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: setsearch
Prototype: lGGD0,L,
Help: setsearch(S,x,{flag=0}): looks if x belongs to the set S. If flag is 0
 or omitted, returns 0 if it is not, otherwise returns the index j such that
 x==S[j]. If flag is non-zero, return 0 if x belongs to S, otherwise the
 index j where it should be inserted.
Doc: searches if $x$ belongs to the set $S$ (see \kbd{setisset}).
 A set is a vector of \typ{STR}, but this function
 works also if $S$ is a arbitrary \emph{sorted} vector or list (see
 \kbd{listsort}): if $x$ is not a \typ{STR}, we first
 replace it by \kbd{Str}$(x)$ \emph{unless} the first element of $S$ is also
 not a \typ{STR}.
 
 If $x$ belongs to the set and $\fl$ is zero or omitted, returns the
 index $j$ such that $S[j]=x$, otherwise returns 0. If $\fl$ is non-zero
 returns the index $j$ where $x$ should be inserted, and $0$ if it already
 belongs to $S$ (this is meant to be used in conjunction with
 \kbd{listinsert}, see below).
 \bprog
 ? T = [2,3,5,7]; S = Set(T);
 ? setsearch(S, 2)      \\ search in a true set, t_INT 2 converted to string
 %2 = 1
 ? setsearch(S, Str(2)) \\ search in a true set, no need for conversion
 %3 = 1
 ? setsearch(T, 2)      \\ search in a sorted vector, no need for conversion
 %4 = 1
 ? setsearch(T, Str(2)) \\ search in a sorted vector, t_STR "2" not found
 %5 = 0
 ? setsearch(S, 4)      \\ not found
 %6 = 0

Help: setunion(x,y): union of the sets x and y.
Description: 
 (vec, vec):vec        setunion($1, $2)
Doc: union of the two sets $x$ and $y$ (see \kbd{setisset}).
 The function also works if both $x$ and $y$ are vectors of strictly increasing
 entries, according to \kbd{<}); in that case we return a vector of strictly
 increasing entries, not a set. Otherwise, the result is undefined.

Function: shift
Class: basic
Section: operators
C-Name: gshift
Prototype: GL
Help: shift(x,n): shift x left n bits if n>=0, right -n bits if
 n<0.
Doc: shifts $x$ componentwise left by $n$ bits if $n\ge0$ and right by $|n|$
 bits if $n<0$. May be abbreviated as $x$ \kbd{<<} $n$ or $x$ \kbd{>>} $(-n)$.
 A left shift by $n$ corresponds to multiplication by $2^n$. A right shift of an
 integer $x$ by $|n|$ corresponds to a Euclidean division of $x$ by $2^{|n|}$
 with a remainder of the same sign as $x$, hence is not the same (in general) as
 $x \kbd{\bs} 2^n$.

Function: shiftmul
Class: basic
Section: operators
C-Name: gmul2n
Prototype: GL
Help: shiftmul(x,n): multiply x by 2^n (n>=0 or n<0)
Doc: multiplies $x$ by $2^n$. The difference with
 \kbd{shift} is that when $n<0$, ordinary division takes place, hence for
 example if $x$ is an integer the result may be a fraction, while for shifts
 Euclidean division takes place when $n<0$ hence if $x$ is an integer the result
 is still an integer.

Function: sigma
Class: basic
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: gsumdivk
Prototype: GD1,L,
Help: sigma(x,{k=1}): sum of the k-th powers of the divisors of x. k is

 (int, small):int        sumdivk($1, $2)
 (gen, small):gen        gsumdivk($1, $2)
Doc: sum of the $k^{\text{th}}$ powers of the positive divisors of $|x|$. $x$
 and $k$ must be of type integer.
 The function accepts vector/matrices arguments for $x$, and is then applied
 componentwise.
Variant: Also available are

Function: simplify

C-Name: simplify
Prototype: G
Help: simplify(x): simplify the object x as much as possible.
Doc: 
 this function simplifies $x$ as much as it can. Specifically, a complex or
 quadratic number whose imaginary part is the integer 0 (i.e.~not \kbd{Mod(0,2)}
 or \kbd{0.E-28}) is converted to its real part, and a polynomial of degree $0$
 is converted to its constant term. Simplifications occur recursively.
 
 This function is especially useful before using arithmetic functions,
 which expect integer arguments:
 \bprog
 ? x = 2 + y - y
 %1 = 2
 ? isprime(x)
   ***   at top-level: isprime(x)
   ***                 ^----------
   *** isprime: not an integer argument in an arithmetic function
 ? type(x)
 %2 = "t_POL"
 ? type(simplify(x))
 %3 = "t_INT"
 @eprog
 Note that GP results are simplified as above before they are stored in the
 history. (Unless you disable automatic simplification with \b{y}, that is.)

Help: sizedigit(x): maximum number of decimal digits minus one of (the

Doc: 
 outputs a quick bound for the number of decimal
 digits of (the components of) $x$, off by at most $1$. If you want the
 exact value, you can use \kbd{\#Str(x)}, which is slower.

Function: solve

 \var{expr} between $a$ and $b$, under the condition
 $\var{expr}(X=a) * \var{expr}(X=b) \le 0$. (You will get an error message
 \kbd{roots must be bracketed in solve} if this does not hold.)

 (gen):gen        gsqr($1)
Doc: square of $x$. This operation is not completely
 straightforward, i.e.~identical to $x * x$, since it can usually be
 computed more efficiently (roughly one-half of the elementary
 multiplications can be saved). Also, squaring a $2$-adic number increases
 its precision. For example,
 \bprog
 ? (1 + O(2^4))^2
 %1 = 1 + O(2^5)
 ? (1 + O(2^4)) * (1 + O(2^4))
 %2 = 1 + O(2^4)
 @eprog\noindent
 Note that this function is also called whenever one multiplies two objects
 which are known to be \emph{identical}, e.g.~they are the value of the same
 variable, or we are computing a power.
 \bprog
 ? x = (1 + O(2^4)); x * x
 %3 = 1 + O(2^5)

Doc: principal branch of the square root of $x$, defined as $\sqrt{x} =

 $\text{Arg}(\text{sqrt}(x))\in{} ]-\pi/2, \pi/2]$, and if $x\in \R$ and $x<0$,
 then the result is complex with positive imaginary part.
 
 Intmod a prime $p$ and $p$-adics are allowed as arguments. In that case,
 the square root (if it exists) which is returned is the one whose
 first $p$-adic digit is in the interval $[0,p/2]$. When the argument is an

Doc: principal branch of the $n$th root of $x$,
 i.e.~such that $\text{Arg}(\text{sqrt}(x))\in{} ]-\pi/n, \pi/n]$. Intmod
 a prime and $p$-adics are allowed as arguments.
 
 If $z$ is present, it is set to a suitable root of unity allowing to
 recover all the other roots. If it was not possible, z is
 set to zero. In the case this argument is present and no square root exist,
 $0$ is returned instead or raising an error.

 the number of ways of partitioning a set of $n$ elements into $k$ non-empty

 $$\sum_k s(n,k) x^k = x(x-1)\dots(x-n+1).$$
 Similarly, if a large number of $S(n,k)$ are needed for the same $k$,
 one should use
 $$\sum_n S(n,k) x^n = \dfrac{x^k}{(1-x)\dots(1-kx)}.$$

 If \var{bound} is present, and is a positive integer, restrict the output to
 subgroups of index less than \var{bound}. If \var{bound} is a vector
 containing a single positive integer $B$, then only subgroups of index

Doc: replace the simple variable $y$ by the argument $z$ in the ``polynomial''

 polynomial (or power series, or rational function), the substitution will be
 done as if the scalar components were polynomials of degree zero. In
 particular, beware that:

 If $x$ is a power series, $z$ must be either a polynomial, a power
 series, or a rational function. Finally, if $x$ is a vector,
 matrix or list, the substitution is applied to each individual entry.

 expression $x$. Every type is allowed for $x$, but the same behavior
 as \kbd{subst} above apply.
 
 The difference with \kbd{subst} is that $y$ is allowed to be any polynomial
 here. The substitution is done moding out all components of $x$
 (recursively) by $y - t$, where $t$ is a new free variable of lowest
 priority. Then substituting $t$ by $z$ in the resulting expression. For
 instance
 \bprog

Doc: numerical summation of \var{expr}, the variable $X$ taking integer values
 from ceiling of $a$ to $+\infty$, where \var{expr} is assumed to be a
 holomorphic function $f(X)$ for $\Re(X)\ge \sigma$.
 
 The parameter $\sigma\in\R$ is coded in the argument \kbd{sig} as follows: it
 is either
 
 \item a real number $\sigma$. Then the function $f$ is assumed to
 decrease at least as $1/X^2$ at infinity, but not exponentially;
 
 \item a two-component vector $[\sigma,\alpha]$, where $\sigma$ is as
 before, $\alpha < -1$. The function $f$ is assumed to decrease like
 $X^{\alpha}$. In particular, $\alpha\le-2$ is equivalent to no $\alpha$ at all.
 
 \item a two-component vector $[\sigma,\alpha]$, where $\sigma$ is as
 before, $\alpha > 0$. The function $f$ is assumed to decrease like
 $\exp(-\alpha X)$. In this case it is essential that $\alpha$ be exactly the
 rate of exponential decrease, and it is usually a good idea to increase
 the default value of $m$ used for the integration step. In practice, if
 the function is exponentially decreasing \kbd{sumnum} is slower and less
 accurate than \kbd{sumpos} or \kbd{suminf}, so should not be used.
 
 The function uses the \tet{intnum} routines and integration on the line
 $\Re(s) = \sigma$. The optional argument \var{tab} is as in intnum, except it
 must be initialized with \kbd{sumnuminit} instead of \kbd{intnuminit}.
 
 When \var{tab} is not precomputed, \kbd{sumnum} can be slower than
 \kbd{sumpos}, when the latter is applicable. It is in general faster for
 slowly decreasing functions.
 
 Finally, if $\fl$ is nonzero, we assume that the function $f$ to be summed is
 of real type, i.e. satisfies $\overline{f(z)}=f(\overline{z})$, which
 speeds up the computation.

  (gen,gen,1):gen:prec sumpos2(${2 cookie}, ${2 wrapper}, $1, prec)
Doc: numerical summation of the series \var{expr}, which must be a series of
 terms having the same sign, the formal variable $X$ starting at $a$. The
 algorithm used is Van Wijngaarden's trick for converting such a series into
 an alternating one, then we use \tet{sumalt}. For regular functions, the
 function \kbd{sumnum} is in general much faster once the initializations
 have been made using \kbd{sumnuminit}.
 
 The routine is heuristic and assumes that \var{expr} is more or less a
 decreasing function of $X$. In particular, the result will be completely
 wrong if \var{expr} is 0 too often. We do not check either that all terms
 have the same sign. As \tet{sumalt}, this function should be used to
 try and guess the value of an infinite sum.
 
 If $\fl=1$, use slightly different polynomials. Sometimes faster.

Class: gp

C-Name: system0
Prototype: vs
Help: system(str): str being a string, execute the system command str.
Doc: \var{str} is a string representing a system command. This command is
 executed, its output written to the standard output (this won't get into your
 logfile), and control returns to the PARI system. This simply calls the C
 \kbd{system} command.

C-Name: tayl

Help: taylor(x,t,{d=seriesprecision}): taylor expansion of x with respect to

Doc: Taylor expansion around $0$ of $x$ with respect to
 the simple variable $t$. $x$ can be of any reasonable type, for example a
 rational function. Contrary to \tet{Ser}, which takes the valuation into
 account, this function adds $O(t^d)$ to all components of $x$.
 \bprog

 %1 = (y^4 - y^3 + y^2 - y + 1)*x + O(y^5)

 \fun{GEN}{vecthetanullk}{GEN q, long k, long prec} returns the vector

Function: thue
Class: basic
Section: polynomials
C-Name: thue
Prototype: GGDG
Help: thue(tnf,a,{sol}): solve the equation P(x,y)=a, where tnf was created
 with thueinit(P), and sol, if present, contains the solutions of Norm(x)=a
 modulo units in the number field defined by P. If tnf was computed without
 assuming GRH (flag 1 in thueinit), the result is unconditional.
Doc: returns all solutions of the equation
 $P(x,y)=a$ in integers $x$ and $y$, where \var{tnf} was created with
 $\kbd{thueinit}(P)$. If present, \var{sol} must contain the solutions of
 $\Norm(x)=a$ modulo units of positive norm in the number field
 defined by $P$ (as computed by \kbd{bnfisintnorm}). If there are infinitely
 many solutions, an error will be issued.
 
 If \var{tnf} was computed without assuming GRH (flag $1$ in \tet{thueinit}),
 then the result is unconditional. Otherwise, it depends in principle of the
 truth of the GRH, but may still be unconditionally correct in some
 favourable cases. The result is conditional on the GRH if
 $a\neq \pm 1$ and, $P$ has a single irreducible rational factor, whose
 associated tentative class number $h$ and regulator $R$ (as computed
 assuming the GRH) satisfy
 
 \item $h > 1$,
 
 \item $R/0.2 > 1.5$.
 
 Here's how to solve the Thue equation $x^{13} - 5y^{13} = - 4$:
 \bprog
 ? tnf = thueinit(x^13 - 5);
 ? thue(tnf, -4)
 %1 = [[1, 1]]
 @eprog
 Hence, the only solution is $(x,y) = (1,1)$, and the result is
 unconditional. On the other hand:
 \bprog
 ? P = x^3-2*x^2+3*x-17; tnf = thueinit(P);
 ? thue(tnf, -15)
 %2 = [[1, 1]]  \\ a priori conditional on the GRH.
 ? K = bnfinit(P); K.no
 %3 = 3
 ? K.ref
 %4 = 2.8682185139262873674706034475498755834
 @eprog
 This time the result is conditional. All results computed using this
 particular \var{tnf} are likewise conditional, \emph{except} for a right-hand
 side of $\pm 1$.
 The above result is in fact correct, so we did not just disprove the GRH:
 \bprog
 ? tnf = thueinit(x^3-2*x^2+3*x-17, 1 /*unconditional*/);
 ? thue(tnf, -15)
 %4 = [[1, 1]]
 @eprog
 Note that reducible or non-monic polynomials are allowed:
 \bprog
 ? tnf = thueinit((2*x+1)^5 * (4*x^3-2*x^2+3*x-17), 1);
 ? thue(tnf, 128)
 %2 = [[-1, 0], [1, 0]]
 @eprog\noindent Reducible polynomials are in fact much easier to handle.

Function: thueinit
Class: basic
Section: polynomials
C-Name: thueinit
Prototype: GD0,L,p
Help: thueinit(P,{flag=0}): initialize the tnf corresponding to P, that will
 be used to solve Thue equations P(x,y) = some-integer. If flag is non-zero,
 certify the result unconditionnaly. Otherwise, assume GRH (much faster of
 course).
Doc: initializes the \var{tnf} corresponding to $P$, a univariate polynomial
 with integer coefficients. The result is meant to be used in conjunction with
 \tet{thue} to solve Thue equations $P(X / Y)Y^{\deg P} = a$, where $a$ is an
 integer.
 
 If $\fl$ is non-zero, certify results unconditionally. Otherwise, assume
 \idx{GRH}, this being much faster of course. In the latter case, the result
 may still be unconditionally correct, see \tet{thue}. For instance in most
 cases where $P$ is reducible (not a pure power of an irreducible), \emph{or}
 conditional computed class groups are trivial \emph{or} the right hand side
 is $\pm1$, then results are always unconditional.

Function: trace
Class: basic
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: gtrace
Prototype: G
Help: trace(x): trace of x.
Doc: this applies to quite general $x$. If $x$ is not a
 matrix, it is equal to the sum of $x$ and its conjugate, except for polmods
 where it is the trace as an algebraic number.
 
 For $x$ a square matrix, it is the ordinary trace. If $x$ is a
 non-square matrix (but not a vector), an error occurs.

Function: trap
Class: basic
Section: programming/specific
C-Name: trap0
Prototype: DrDEDE
Help: trap({e}, {rec}, seq): try to execute seq, trapping runtime error e (all
 of them if e ommitted); sequence rec is executed if the error occurs and
 is the result of the command.
Wrapper: (,_,_)
Description: 
 (?str,?closure,?closure):gen trap0($1, $2, $3)
Doc: tries to
 evaluate \var{seq}, trapping runtime error $e$, that is effectively preventing
 it from aborting computations in the usual way; the recovery sequence
 \var{rec} is executed if the error occurs and the evaluation of \var{rec}
 becomes the result of the command. If $e$ is omitted, all exceptions are
 trapped. See \secref{se:errorrec} for an introduction to error recovery
 under \kbd{gp}.
 
 \bprog
 ? \\@com trap division by 0
 ? inv(x) = trap (gdiver, INFINITY, 1/x)
 ? inv(2)
 %1 = 1/2
 ? inv(0)
 %2 = INFINITY
 @eprog\noindent
 Note that \var{seq} is effectively evaluated up to the point that produced
 the error, and the recovery sequence is evaluated starting from that same
 context, it does not "undo" whatever happened in the other branch (restore
 the evaluation context):
 \bprog
 ? x = 1; trap (, /* recover: */ x, /* try: */ x = 0; 1/x)
 %1 = 0
 @eprog
 
 \misctitle{Note} The interface is currently not adequate for trapping
 individual exceptions. In the current version \vers, the following keywords
 are recognized, but the name list will be expanded and changed in the
 future (all library mode errors can be trapped: it's a matter of defining
 the keywords to \kbd{gp}):
 
 \kbd{alarmer}: alarm time-out
 
 \kbd{archer}: not available on this architecture or operating system
 
 \kbd{errpile}: the PARI stack overflows
 
 \kbd{gdiver}: division by 0

 \kbd{user}: user error (from the \kbd{error} function)

Function: truncate
Class: basic
Section: conversions
C-Name: trunc0
Prototype: GD&
Help: truncate(x,{&e}): truncation of x; when x is a power series,take away
 the O(X^). If e is present, do not take into account loss of integer part
 precision, and set e = error estimate in bits.
Description: 
 (small):small:parens   $1
 (int):int:copy:parens  $1
 (real):int             truncr($1)
 (mp):int               mptrunc($1)

 (gen, &small):gen      gcvtoi($1, &$2)
 (gen, &int):gen        trunc0($1, &$2)
Doc: truncates $x$ and sets $e$ to the number of
 error bits. When $x$ is in $\R$, this means that the part after the decimal
 point is chopped away, $e$ is the binary exponent of the difference between
 the original and the truncated value (the ``fractional part''). If the
 exponent of $x$ is too large compared to its precision (i.e.~$e>0$), the
 result is undefined and an error occurs if $e$ was not given. The function
 applies componentwise on vector / matrices; $e$ is then the maximal number of
 error bits. If $x$ is a rational function, the result is the ``integer part''
 (Euclidean quotient of numerator by denominator) and $e$ is not set.
 
 Note a very special use of \kbd{truncate}: when applied to a power series, it
 transforms it into a polynomial or a rational function with denominator
 a power of $X$, by chopping away the $O(X^k)$. Similarly, when applied to
 a $p$-adic number, it transforms it into an integer or a rational number
 by chopping away the $O(p^k)$.
Variant: The following functions are also available: \fun{GEN}{gtrunc}{GEN x}
 and \fun{GEN}{gcvtoi}{GEN x, long *e}.

Function: type
Class: basic
Section: programming/specific
C-Name: type0
Prototype: G
Help: type(x): return the type of the GEN x.
Description: 
 (gen):typ              typ($1)
Doc: this is useful only under \kbd{gp}. Returns the internal type name of
 the PARI object $x$ as a  string. Check out existing type names with the
 metacommand \b{t}. For example \kbd{type(1)} will return "\typ{INT}".
Variant: The macro \kbd{typ} is usually simpler to use since it returns a
 \kbd{long} that can easily be matched with the symbols \typ{*}. The name
 \kbd{type} was avoided since it is a reserved identifier for some compilers.

C-Name: untilpari
Prototype: vEI
Help: until(a,seq): evaluate the expression sequence seq until a is nonzero.
Doc: evaluates \var{seq} until $a$ is not
 equal to 0 (i.e.~until $a$ is true). If $a$ is initially not equal to 0,
 \var{seq} is evaluated once (more generally, the condition on $a$ is tested
 \emph{after} execution of the \var{seq}, not before as in \kbd{while}).

Function: valuation
Class: basic
Section: conversions
C-Name: ggval
Prototype: lGG
Help: valuation(x,p): valuation of x with respect to p.
Doc: 
 computes the highest
 exponent of $p$ dividing $x$. If $p$ is of type integer, $x$ must be an
 integer, an intmod whose modulus is divisible by $p$, a fraction, a
 $q$-adic number with $q=p$, or a polynomial or power series in which case the
 valuation is the minimum of the valuation of the coefficients.
 
 If $p$ is of type polynomial, $x$ must be of type polynomial or rational
 function, and also a power series if $x$ is a monomial. Finally, the
 valuation of a vector, complex or quadratic number is the minimum of the
 component valuations.
 
 If $x=0$, the result is \tet{LONG_MAX} ($2^{31}-1$ for 32-bit machines or
 $2^{63}-1$ for 64-bit machines) if $x$ is an exact object. If $x$ is a
 $p$-adic numbers or power series, the result is the exponent of the zero.
 Any other type combinations gives an error.

Function: variable
Class: basic
Section: conversions
C-Name: gpolvar
Prototype: DG
Help: variable({x}): main variable of object x. Gives p for p-adic x, error
 for scalars. Returns the list of user variables if x is omitted.
Description: 
 (pol):var:parens:copy        $var:1
 (gen):gen        gpolvar($1)
Doc: 
 gives the main variable of the object $x$, and
 $p$ if $x$ is a $p$-adic number. Gives an error if $x$ has no variable
 associated to it. If $x$ is omitted, returns the list of user variables known
 to the interpreter, by order of decreasing priority. (Highest priority is $x$,
 which always come first.)
Variant: However, in library mode, this function should not be used for $x$
 non-\kbd{NULL}, since \tet{gvar} is more appropriate. Instead, for
 $x$ a $p$-adic (type \typ{PADIC}), $p$ is $gel(x,2)$; otherwise, use
 \fun{long}{gvar}{GEN x} which returns the variable number of $x$ if
 it exists, \kbd{NO\_VARIABLE} otherwise, which satisfies the property
 $\kbd{varncmp}(\kbd{NO\_VARIABLE}, v) > 0$ for all valid variable number
 $v$, i.e. it has lower priority than any variable.

Function: vecextract
Class: basic
Section: linear_algebra
C-Name: extract0
Prototype: GGDG
Help: vecextract(x,y,{z}): extraction of the components of the matrix or
 vector x according to y and z. If z is omitted, y represents columns, otherwise
 y corresponds to rows and z to columns. y and z can be vectors (of indices),
 strings (indicating ranges as in "1..10") or masks (integers whose binary
 representation indicates the indices to extract, from left to right 1, 2, 4,
 8, etc.).
Description: 
 (vec,gen,?gen):vec  extract0($1, $2, $3)
Doc: extraction of components of the
 vector or matrix $x$ according to $y$. In case $x$ is a matrix, its
 components are as usual the \emph{columns} of $x$. The parameter $y$ is a
 component specifier, which is either an integer, a string describing a
 range, or a vector.
 
 If $y$ is an integer, it is considered as a mask: the binary bits of $y$ are
 read from right to left, but correspond to taking the components from left to
 right. For example, if $y=13=(1101)_2$ then the components 1,3 and 4 are
 extracted.
 
 If $y$ is a vector, which must have integer entries, these entries correspond
 to the component numbers to be extracted, in the order specified.
 
 If $y$ is a string, it can be
 
 \item a single (non-zero) index giving a component number (a negative
 index means we start counting from the end).
 
 \item a range of the form \kbd{"$a$..$b$"}, where $a$ and $b$ are
 indexes as above. Any of $a$ and $b$ can be omitted; in this case, we take
 as default values $a = 1$ and $b = -1$, i.e.~ the first and last components
 respectively. We then extract all components in the interval $[a,b]$, in
 reverse order if $b < a$.
 
 In addition, if the first character in the string is \kbd{\pow}, the
 complement of the given set of indices is taken.
 
 If $z$ is not omitted, $x$ must be a matrix. $y$ is then the \emph{line}
 specifier, and $z$ the \emph{column} specifier, where the component specifier
 is as explained above.

 (vec, ?gen, small):gen         vecsort0($1, $2, $3)
Doc: sorts the vector $x$ in ascending order, using a mergesort method.
 $x$ must be a list, vector or matrix (seen as a vector of its columns).
 Note that mergesort is stable, hence the initial ordering of ``equal''
 entries (with respect to the sorting criterion) is not changed.
 
 If \kbd{cmp} is omitted, we use the standard comparison function
 \kbd{<}, thereby restricting the possible types for the elements of $x$
 (integers, fractions or reals). If \kbd{cmp} is present, it is understood as
 a comparison function and we sort according to it. The following
 possibilities exist:
 
 \item an integer $k$: sort according to the value of the $k$-th
 subcomponents of the components of~$x$.
 
 \item a vector: sort lexicographically according to the components listed in
 the vector. For example, if $\kbd{cmp}=\kbd{[2,1,3]}$, sort with respect to
 the second component, and when these are equal, with respect to the first,
 and when these are equal, with respect to the third.
 
 \item a comparison function (\typ{CLOSURE}), with two arguments $x$ and $y$,
 and returning an integer which is $<0$, $>0$ or $=0$ if $x<y$, $x>y$ or
 $x=y$ respectively. The \tet{sign} function is very useful in this context:
 \bprog
 ? vecsort([3,0,2; 1,0,2],lex) \\ sort columns according to lex order
 %1 =
 [2 3]
 
 [2 1]
 ? vecsort(v, (x,y)->sign(y-x))            \\@com reverse sort
 ? vecsort(v, (x,y)->sign(abs(x)-abs(y)))  \\@com sort by increasing absolute value
 ? cmp(x,y) = my(dx = poldisc(x), dy = poldisc(y)); sign(abs(dx) - abs(dy))
 ? vecsort([x^2+1, x^3-2, x^4+5*x+1], cmp)
 @eprog\noindent
 The last example used the named \kbd{cmp} instead of an anonymous function,
 and sorts polynomials with respect to the absolute value of their
 discriminant. A more efficient approach would use precomputations to ensure
 a given discriminant is computed only once:
 \bprog
 ? DISC = vector(#v, i, abs(poldisc(v[i])));
 ? perm = vecsort(vector(#v,i,i), (x,y)->sign(DISC[x]-DISC[y]))
 ? vecextract(v, perm)
 @eprog\noindent Similar ideas apply whenever we sort according to the values
 of a function which is expensive to compute.
 
 \noindent The binary digits of \fl\ mean:
 
 \item 1: indirect sorting of the vector $x$, i.e.~if $x$ is an
 $n$-component vector, returns a permutation of $[1,2,\dots,n]$ which
 applied to the components of $x$ sorts $x$ in increasing order.
 For example, \kbd{vecextract(x, vecsort(x,,1))} is equivalent to
 \kbd{vecsort(x)}.
 
 \item 2: sorts $x$ by ascending lexicographic order (as per the
 \kbd{lex} comparison function).
 
 \item 4: use descending instead of ascending order.
 
 \item 8: remove ``duplicate'' entries with respect to the sorting function
 (keep the first occurring entry).  For example:
 \bprog
   ? vecsort([Pi,Mod(1,2),z], (x,y)->0, 8)   \\@com make everything compare equal
   %1 = [3.141592653589793238462643383]
   ? vecsort([[2,3],[0,1],[0,3]], 2, 8)

Function: version
Class: basic
Section: programming/specific
C-Name: pari_version
Prototype: 
Help: version(): returns the PARI version as [major,minor,patch] or [major,minor,patch,VCSversion].
Doc: returns the current version number as a \typ{VEC} with three integer
 components (major version number, minor version number and patchlevel);
 if your sources were obtained through our version control system, this will
 be followed by a more precise version string, e.g.~\kbd{git-}\emph{commit
 hash}.
 
 This function is present in all versions of PARI following releases 2.3.4
 (stable) and 2.4.3 (testing).
 
 Unless you are working with multiple development versions, you probably only
 care about the 3 first numeric components. In any case, the \kbd{lex} function
 offers a clever way to check against a particular version number, since it will
 compare each successive vector entry, numerically or as strings, and will not
 mind if the vectors it compares have different lengths :
 \bprog
    if (lex(version(), [2,3,5]) >= 0,
      \\ code to be executed if we are running 2.3.5 or more recent.
    ,
      \\ compatibility code
    );
 @eprog\noindent On a number of different machines, \kbd{version()} could return either of
 \bprog
  %1 = [2, 3, 4]    \\ released version, stable branch
  %1 = [2, 4, 3]    \\ released version, testing branch
  %1 = [2, 6, 0, "git-2cce227"] \\ development
 @eprog
 
 In particular the first line of the gp introductory message can be essentially
 emulated by
 \bprog
    v = version();
    n = Str(v[1], ".", v[2], ".", v[3]);
    s = if (#v > 3, v[4], "");
    print("GP/PARI CALCULATOR Version ", n, " (", s, ")");
  @eprog\noindent If you \emph{are} working with many development versions of
  PARI/GP, the last component can be profitably included in the name of
  your logfile, for instance.

 2: function f2(x)=sqrt(2)*eta(2*x)/eta(x). Note that
 j = (f^24-16)^3/f^24 = (f1^24+16)^3/f1^24 = (f2^24+16)^3/f2^24.
Doc: one of Weber's three $f$ functions.

Class: basic

C-Name: gpwritebin
Prototype: vsDG
Help: writebin(filename,{x}): write x as a binary object to file filename.
 If x is omitted, write all session variables.
Doc: writes (appends) to
 \var{filename} the object $x$ in binary format. This format is not human
 readable, but contains the exact internal structure of $x$, and is much
 faster to save/load than a string expression, as would be produced by
 \tet{write}. The binary file format includes a magic number, so that such a
 file can be recognized and correctly input by the regular \tet{read} or \b{r}
 function. If saved objects refer to (polynomial) variables that are not
 defined in the new session, they will be displayed in a funny way (see
 \secref{se:kill}).
 
 If $x$ is omitted, saves all user variables from the session, together with
 their names. Reading such a ``named object'' back in a \kbd{gp} session will set
 the corresponding user variable to the saved value. E.g after
 \bprog
 x = 1; writebin("log")
 @eprog\noindent
 reading \kbd{log} into a clean session will set \kbd{x} to $1$.
 The relative variables priorities (see \secref{se:priority}) of new variables
 set in this way remain the same (preset variables retain their former
 priority, but are set to the new value). In particular, reading such a
 session log into a clean session will restore all variables exactly as they
 were in the original one.
 
 User functions, installed functions and history objects can not be saved via
 this function. Just as a regular input file, a binary file can be compressed
 using \tet{gzip}, provided the file name has the standard \kbd{.gz}
 extension.\sidx{binary file}
 
 In the present implementation, the binary files are architecture dependent
 and compatibility with future versions of \kbd{gp} is not guaranteed. Hence
 binary files should not be used for long term storage (also, they are
 larger and harder to compress than text files).

 lambdak function, i.e. with the gamma factors.
Doc: \var{znf} being a number
 field initialized by \kbd{zetakinit} (\emph{not} by \kbd{nfinit}),
 computes the value of the \idx{Dedekind} zeta function of the number
 field at the complex number $x$. If $\fl=1$ computes Dedekind $\Lambda$
 function instead (i.e.~the product of the Dedekind zeta function by its gamma
 and exponential factors).
 
 \misctitle{CAVEAT} This implementation is not satisfactory and must be
 rewritten. In particular
 
 \item The accuracy of the result depends in an essential way on the
 accuracy of both the \kbd{zetakinit} program and the current accuracy.
 Be wary in particular that $x$ of large imaginary part or, on the
 contrary, very close to an ordinary integer will suffer from precision
 loss, yielding fewer significant digits than expected. Computing with 28
 digits of relative accuracy, we have

C-Name: initzeta
Prototype: Gp
Help: zetakinit(bnf): compute number field information necessary to use zetak.
 bnf may also be an irreducible polynomial.
Doc: computes a number of initialization data
 concerning the number field associated to \kbd{bnf} so as to be able
 to compute the \idx{Dedekind} zeta and lambda functions, respectively
 $\kbd{zetak}(x)$ and $\kbd{zetak}(x,1)$, at the current real precision. If
 you do not need the \kbd{bnfinit} data somewhere else, you may call it
 with an irreducible polynomial instead of a \var{bnf}: it will call
 \kbd{bnfinit} itself.
 
 The result is a 9-component vector $v$ whose components are very technical
 and cannot really be used except through the \kbd{zetak} function.
 
 This function is very inefficient and should be rewritten. It needs to
 computes millions of coefficients of the corresponding Dirichlet series if
 the precision is big. Unless the discriminant is small it will not be able
 to handle more than 9 digits of relative precision. For instance,
 \kbd{zetakinit(x\pow 8 - 2)} needs 440MB of memory at default precision.

Function: zncoppersmith

 with |x| <= X such that  gcd(N, P(x)) >= B. X should be smaller than
 exp((log B)^2 / (deg(P) log N)).
Doc: $N$ being an integer and $P\in \Z[X]$, finds all integers $x$ with
 $|x| \leq X$ such that
 $$\gcd(N, P(x)) \geq B,$$
 using \idx{Coppersmith}'s algorithm (a famous application of the \idx{LLL}
 algorithm). $X$ must be smaller than $\exp(\log^2 B / (\deg(P) \log N))$:
 for $B = N$, this means $X < N^{1/\deg(P)}$. Some $x$ larger than $X$ may
 be returned if you are very lucky. The smaller $B$ (or the larger $X$), the
 slower the routine will be. The strength of Coppersmith method is the
 ability to find roots modulo a general \emph{composite} $N$: if $N$ is a prime
 or a prime power, \tet{polrootsmod} or \tet{polrootspadic} will be much
 faster.
 
 We shall now present two simple applications. The first one is
 finding non-trivial factors of $N$, given some partial information on the
 factors; in that case $B$ must obviously be smaller than the largest
 non-trivial divisor of $N$.
 \bprog
 setrand(1); \\ to make the example reproducible
 p = nextprime(random(10^30));
 q = nextprime(random(10^30)); N = p*q;
 p0 = p % 10^20; \\ assume we know 1) p > 10^29, 2) the last 19 digits of p
 p1 = zncoppersmith(10^19*x + p0, N, 10^12, 10^29)
 
 \\ result in 10ms.
 %1 = [35023733690]
 ? gcd(p1[1] * 10^19 + p0, N) == p
 %2 = 1
 @eprog\noindent and we recovered $p$, faster than by trying all
 possibilities $ < 10^{12}$.
 
 The second application is an attack on RSA with low exponent, when the
 message $x$ is short and the padding $P$ is known to the attacker. We use
 the same RSA modulus $N$ as in the first example:
 \bprog
 setrand(1);
 P = random(N);    \\ known padding
 e = 3;            \\ small public encryption exponent
 X = floor(N^0.3); \\ N^(1/e - epsilon)
 x0 = random(X);   \\ unknown short message
 C = lift( (Mod(x0,N) + P)^e ); \\ known ciphertext, with padding P
 zncoppersmith((P + x)^3 - C, N, X)
 
 \\ result in 3.8s.
 %3 = [265174753892462432]
 ? %[1] == x0
 %4 = 1

 The latter two algorithms require $O(\sqrt{q})$ operations in the group on

 undefined. If $n$ is a prime, then the smallest positive primitive root is
 returned. This is no longer true for composites.
 
 Note that this function requires factoring $p-1$ for $p$ as above,
