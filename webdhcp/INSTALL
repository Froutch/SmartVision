This program requires the following Perl Modules before it will work:

* Crypt-Blowfish-2.06
* Crypt-CBC-1.25
* Crypt-CBCeasy-0.21
* MD5-1.7
 
This is how the files in this distro should layout:

Server Side:
-----------
Webdhcp_Server.pm 
INSTALL
README
init.webdhcpd
webdhcp_server

Client Side:
-----------
COPYRIGHT 
INSTALL
MANIFEST
Webdhcp_Client.pm
webdhcp_client.cgi 
webdhcp_client.conf
example_doc

1) Run 'perl Makefile.PL'
2) Edit 'Webdhcp_Client.pm' and 'webdhcp_server' so that their
   "$encryptkey" values are the same. Also, checkout the 
   region in 'Webdhcp_Client.pm', 'webdhcp_server', and 
   'Webdhcp_Server.pm' that says you should edit them before
   putting the program into production.
3) Run 'make'
4) Run 'make test'
5) Run 'make install'

Next question, is the DHCP server on the same machine as the
Web server that the user(s) interface with? The answer to this
question should be no because that would be potential security
risk, however, if the answer is "yes" then

6) ./install.bin server
7) ./install.bin client

----- OR -------

If the answer was "no", then on the DHCP Server run:

6) ./install.bin server

And on the Web Server run:

7) ./install.bin client

That's It! Check the "install.log" for details of the installation. 
The server could be started by running the "init.webdhcpd" script.
Also, you note that the assumed location for perl is '/usr/bin/perl'.
If this is not the case, then you should be able to modify the
'#!/usr/bin/perl' line in each of the perl scripts.
